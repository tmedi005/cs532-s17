   [146]Super Bowl

This Is What Happened When We Tried to Spend a $5 Million Super Bowl Budget
on Facebook

   By [147]Todd Lombardo. Published on February 01, 2017.

   I'm breaking the most golden rule here, the one where a marketer isn't
   supposed to bash the Super Bowl, because an ad running during the
   biggest of the big games is the Super Bowl of advertising
   opportunities.

   Right?

   I mean, last year's game averaged [148]111.9 million viewers and
   [149]1.4 million live streamers a minute. And advertising is part of
   what makes the media world go 'round (somebody has to pay for content,
   if not you and me). Plus, brands like [150]Pepsi reported one billion
   media impressions in past Super Bowls for their marketing efforts.
   That's big stuff.

   The role of the Super Bowl is cemented into every ad agency's big fat
   dream: a cluttered awards shelf, and a cultural impact. If you're a Gen
   X or Y standing at the edge of 2017, you likely remember Apple circa
   1984, and know that we still talk about that famous ad today. Wouldn't
   it be nice to create something like that?

   It's also unlikely -- â€Šnot because you're not great, just because it's
   rare for the stars to align just so.

   So, this year, the Super Bowl costs $5 million for 30 seconds --
   $166,667 every second. Surely there are more efficient marketing
   efforts that can be undertaken for far less money, especially in this
   era where brands are equally focused on traditional goals like reach
   and awareness, as well as newer goals like audience development and
   views, views, views.

   In other words, there's gotta be another way.

   How about Facebook?

   We wondered: What would happen if we tried to spend that $5 million
   Super Bowl media budget on Facebook instead?

   Facebook has 1.8 billion monthly active users, and a reported 8 billion
   video views a day. Brands like Crypt TV are being born on Facebook,
   while brands like Tastemade, Harry's Shave Club, Tough Mudder and Red
   Bull are building audiences in the tens of millions that they can come
   back to again and again.

   So we tried, and this is what we got:

   WTF, this is a lot of people.

   Wins:
     * Upwards of 5 million people, every single day, for 11 months.

     * The ability to do many types of content, from images to text to
       videos.

     * Anything that goes viral via engagement, comments and sharing would
       only have additional upside.

   Caveats:

   Surely there would be a more robust offering than this in real life.
   For $5 million, you would get a direct sales team at Facebook, and a
   custom package. And, of course, you'd get boatloads of targeting.
   Still, this gets to the power of Facebook's massive scale, and the
   reason we should be treating it like a grown-up.

   For us, the biggest upside that people don't talk about enough is the
   audience development piece. With enough effort, why not build your own
   audience instead of paying Fox to access theirs for just one day?

   There are brands who avoid paying for the Super Bowl, and do more
   clever things. Take [151]the 2014 Anna Kendrick ambush campaign for
   Newcastle by our friends at Droga5. Their goal was to be the most
   talked about ad of the Super Bowl, without making an ad for the Super
   Bowl. The gambit was award-winning and clever.

   True, the Super Bowl has the water cooler component, if you hit the
   creative out of the park. That matters. And everybody is watching, or
   at least the closest to everybody that's possible with broadcast
   television these days (unlike the days of "M*A*S*H" finales).

   But the question becomes, Does it matter enough, in today's modern
   media culture, where we have so many other tools at our disposal to
   drive reach, views, engagement and such? And has any marketer, ever,
   figured out the ROI of a Super Bowl spot (if you know of one, please
   tweet me because we want to give them an award).

   We heart culture, great ads, thinking outside the box and watching the
   Super Bowl. What else we'll watch: whether any brands just say no to
   the Super Bowl in the future. This year, surprisingly, [152]some
   [153]already [154]have.
