    Diversity, Corporate Social Responsibility and the US Superbowl Ads 2017

   By Catia Malaquias

   In the current political climate in the United States, a number of
   corporate organisations have used some of the most expensive air time,
   the Super Bowl 2017, to make powerful statements about diversity and
   inclusion.  However, it is not the first time that diversity has
   featured strongly as a theme in the Super Bowl commercial
   advertisements.  In an [13]article in Forbes magazine on 30 January
   2017, marketing Professors Charles R. Taylor and John Murphy wrote:

      “The Super Bowl is a microcosm for observing how marketers are
     reacting to societal shifts that underscore the need for frequent,
     realistic, and diverse portrayals of minority groups.”

   Some of the Super Bowl 2017 ads are notable for their willingness to
   make explicit commentary on current social and political issues in the
   United States and, in particular, cultural diversity and America’s
   identity as a nation that has welcomed migrants from all over the
   world.  That messaging taps into consumer market groups, but also
   reinforces corporate strategy that benefits from diversity and
   immigration, including foreign talent and drive.  In fact, Apple,
   Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and more than 100 other companies
   are presently [14]challenging reinstatement of a presidential executive
   order in relation to immigration from certain countries, on the basis
   that it is bad for their business and talent recruitment as well as
   being unconstitutional.

   The following Super Bowl 2017 ads featured diversity and inclusion as
   key themes.

   84 Lumber

   Building supply company 84 Lumber aired the ad “The will to succeed is
   always welcome here” – about a Mexican woman and her daughter who
   journey across the desert towards America, only to come up against a
   “border wall”.

   Budweiser

   Another ad that had people talking was released by brewing company
   Budweiser.  It tells the story of its founder, Adolphus Busch, a German
   immigrant and his journey to the United States to follow his dreams.
   In one frame we hear someone say “Welcome to America” and in another
   someone else yells “Go back home!”.

   Coca Cola

   Coca Cola too made a similar statement about the United States and the
   values of cultural diversity when it re-aired its 2014 Super
   Bowl ad “Its beautiful” featuring the song “America the Beautiful”
   being sung in several languages – English, Spanish, Keres, Tagalog,
   Hindi, Senegalese, French, and Hebrew.

   Expedia

   The Super Bowl 2017 ad by Expedia, which shows a woman learning about
   other cultures through travel, also emphasised cultural diversity and
   our common humanity.

   AirBnb

   Finally, AirBnb also made a strong statement in its ad “We Accept” with
   the clear message in text “Believe no matter who you are, where you’re
   from, who you love, or who you worship, we all belong. The world is
   more beautiful the more you accept.” A hashtag at the end read
   #WeAccept, which went viral by halftime.

   It’s A 10 Hair Care

   The ad aired by It’s A 10 Hair Care was one of the few that portrays
   disability as part of the framework of diversity – it features a
   wheelchair user and a model with Hypertrichosis alongside a diverse
   cast, in a tongue-in-cheek message that references the American
   President’s hair.

     __________________________________________________________________

   This year’s Super Bowl ads demonstrate the potential of inclusive
   advertising as a communication tool to reinforce positive social
   messages.  However, they also suggest the much under-realised potential
   of representing the full range of human diversity – particularly
   disability – which affects 1 in 5 of the world’s population and
   intersects with every other major demographic, including cultural and
   racial diversity, sexual orientation and gender identity.

   You can read more about corporate social responsibility and inclusive
   advertising in our recent report on [21]“Corporate Social Reporting,
   Diversity and Inclusive advertising – Embracing the Future of Inclusive
   Advertising in the Retail Sector”.
