Political

Two out of every three Donald Trump voters turn off awards show when actors,
singers and other entertainers start preaching politics, according to new
data [27]published by the Hollywood Reporter.

   The National Research Group surveyed 800 people — half who voted for
   Hillary Clinton and half who pulled the lever for Donald Trump. The
   data revealed that 66 percent of Trump voters changed the
   channel whenever an actor began to lecture about politics, compared to
   just 19 percent of Clinton voters.

   Another 44 percent of Trump voters said awards show speeches are “too
   political,” compared to Clinton backers who said they
   want more politics at the Academy Awards. About 39 percent of Clinton
   voters want to hear about women’s rights, while another 34 percent
   indicated they want to hear artists speak about Trump’s executive order
   temporarily suspending the United States’ refugee program.

   More than two-thirds, or 68 percent, of Trump voters say they “dislike”
   political speeches at the Oscars, while just 23 percent of Clinton
   voters said they felt the same.

   Interestingly, about 25 percent of Trump and Clinton voters stated that
   they don’t find politically-charged awards show speeches to be
   persuasive.

   The survey also found that 79 percent of Clinton voters plan to watch
   this year’s Oscars, compared to just 66 of Trump voters.

   Asked if Trump should be invited to this year’s Oscars, 62 percent of
   Trump voters said yes, while 84 percent of Clinton supporters said no.

   Of the major awards shows so far this season, the Golden Globes, the
   Grammy Awards and the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards all heavily
   featured politically-charged speeches, with most centering on
   opposition to President Trump and his policies.

   The 89th Academy Awards airs Sunday, February 26 on ABC, with Jimmy
   Kimmel set to host.
