   [102]New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady's missing Super Bowl LI
   game jersey is valued at $500,000 according to a Houston police report
   released Tuesday.
   [javascript] Patriots quarterback Tom Brady went 43-for-62 for 466
   yards and two touchdowns in Super Bowl LI. Andrew Hancock for ESPN

   Brady couldn't find his jersey in the Patriots' locker room after a
   34-28 overtime victory over the [103]Atlanta Falcons at Houston's NRG
   Stadium.

   "I put it in the bag, and I came out and it wasn't there anymore. It's
   unfortunate because that's a nice piece of memorabilia," Brady said the
   day after the game. "If it shows up on eBay somewhere, someone let me
   know so I can track that down."

   Police are classifying the theft as a first-degree felony.
