   [73]comments

   New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick has been added to the
   list of potential defense witnesses who could testify during the
   upcoming double-homicide trial of former tight end Aaron Hernandez.

   The new list of potential witnesses for the defense, which was filed
   last week, also lists Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels and
   Maurkice Pouncey, an offensive lineman for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

   Belichick, who is listed as “William Belichick” on the civilian witness
   list, is not guaranteed to testify during double-murder trial, which is
   slated to start next Wednesday. However his presence on the list
   indicates Hernandez's defense team may call him.

   Hernandez is accused of gunning down Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu, 29,
   and Safiro Furtado, 28, in a roadway drive-by in the early morning
   hours of July 16, 2012, after a drink allegedly was spilled on him at a
   Boston night club. Jury selection for the trial is underway.

   Also listed on the potential witness list in Shayanna Jenkins, the
   mother of Hernandez’s child.

   Hernandez, who was drafted by the Patriots in the fourth round of the
   2010 NFL Draft, has already been convicted of murdering former semipro
   footballer Odin L. Lloyd in 2013. Hernandez is serving a life sentence
   for that crime.

   Ernest Wallace, a friend of Hernandez’s who was convicted on charges of
   accessory to murder after the fact in the 2013 shooting death of Lloyd,
   is also listed as a potential defense witness in the former Patriot’s
   upcoming trial.
