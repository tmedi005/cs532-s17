   NEW YORK DAILY NEWS
   Wednesday, February 22, 2017, 4:40 PM

   After claiming his fifth Super Bowl championship as the head coach of
   the New England Patriots earlier this month, Bill Belichick lamented
   that his franchise was already five weeks behind opponents in preparing
   for the 2017 season.

   He may need to put down the film for another reason.

   In a court filing on Tuesday, Belichick was listed as one of 122
   potential civilian witnesses in the upcoming double homicide trial of
   Aaron Hernandez, a former Patriots tight end. Those names were provided
   by Hernandez’s defense team. Patriots offensive coordinator Josh
   McDaniels was also on the list, as were Hernandez’s former Florida
   Gators teammates, Maurkice and Mike Pouncey.

   David Nelson, a former Gator and New York Jets receiver, is also a
   potential witness.

   The trial is scheduled to start March 1. Jury selection is ongoing.

   Hernandez has been charged in the killings of Safiro Furtado and Daniel
   de Abreu in Boston’s Theatre District on July 16, 2012. Hernandez was
   drafted by Belichick in 2010, and caught a touchdown pass from
   quarterback Tom Brady in the Super Bowl XLVI loss to the Giants five
   months before the double killing. Hernandez is serving a life sentence
   for murdering Odin Lloyd on June 10, 2013.

   If Hernandez is convicted of killing Furtado and de Abreu, that would
   mean that he played a season with the Patriots after doing so.

   Belichick was also listed as a potential witness in the Lloyd trial. He
   was never called, but Patriots owner Bob Kraft testified against
   Hernandez, the player Kraft once rewarded with a five-year contract
   worth up to $40 million.
