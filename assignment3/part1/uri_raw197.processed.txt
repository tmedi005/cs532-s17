The Big Spill: How Tide Pulled Off its Super Bowl Surprise

   When Terry Bradshaw showed up with a shirt stain on what appeared to be
   live TV from the Fox broadcast booth at the Super Bowl, it marked the
   first time an advertiser had tried an integration so complex on so
   large a stage. His spill was, in fact, an elaborate pretaped stunt that
   teed up a commercial to be followed up late in the game with another
   commercial. Making the opening bit appear seamless was a long, highly
   complicated and often tense process for [141]Procter & Gamble, its
   agency [142]Saatchi & Saatchi and the directors at Traktor.

   "Tide's been in the Super Bowl a few times with some pretty great
   success, and so, if we're going to be in the game, we're going to do
   something pretty epic," said Paul Bichler, executive creative director
   at Saatchi & Saatchi. "The stakes were really high and we were dreaming
   up ideas that were never done before."

   Biggest launch
   One key task was for Tide to top itself. Its prior Tide Super Bowl ads
   were viewer favorites and award winners: The hilarious "Talking Stain"
   from 2008 featured a yammering blotch ruining a job interview, and the
   2013 "Miracle Stain" summoned acolytes to worship a blemish that looked
   eerily like Joe Montana. Brand managers also wanted to bring an element
   of newness and surprise to a product that is 70 years old and already
   in almost half of the laundry rooms in the U.S. And failure would be
   costly, because the effort supported the introduction of Tide with
   Downy Pods, the brand's biggest launch of the year.

The Live Bowl (and How It's Changing the TV Landscape)

   "We saw dozens of rounds of scripts, and we are comfortable not
   launching a Super Bowl ad if it doesn't meet that high bar," said Amy
   Krehbiel, P&G associate brand director. "We saw three rounds with lots
   and lots of boards that were very good. They just weren't a Super Bowl
   ad."

   Then came the big idea to have "Fox NFL Sunday" host Mr. Bradshaw get
   caught in the broadcast booth with a spill on his shirt and clean it
   with Tide. "This one rose to the top because it had something that had
   never been done before, with Terry interrupting the middle of the game
   with a stain," Ms. Krehbiel said. "It was unbelievably funny; every
   time we watched it, we had people in the room laugh out loud and it was
   all about that insight that everyone feelsâ€”the anxiety of a stain and
   how, in the end, Tide was what you trust to get it out."

   A lot of eyeballs
   The key was securing the right time in the game for the setup with the
   spill, a commercial in which the soiled shirt was laundered and a
   closing kicker late in the game. And, of course, Mr. Bradshaw had to
   sign on. P&G declined to discuss specifics of its negotiations, but
   said NFL sponsorship helped get access to some league assets.

   Relative to what would follow, those were the easy parts. Mr. Bradshaw
   was game. As a media fixture, he knew the value of a Super Bowl ad.
   "It's going to have well in excess of 100 million [viewers] and more
   than probably a billion people worldwide when it's finally spread out
   in all the countries," Mr. Bradshaw said. "And advertisers, man, that's
   a lot of eyeballs."

   He also said it seemed logical for him to be the guy with the stain.
   "Who better than Curt Menefee and Terry Bradshaw," he said, "because
   I'm the co-host, he's the host and I'm kind of, you know, the guy that
   kind of gets in lots of trouble."

   But P&G could not prerelease its commercial, which is otherwise
   standard operating procedure for most Super Bowl advertisers today, or
   risk any leaks whatsoever, because it would spoil the surprise and the
   social media blaze that executives hoped to ignite.

   'There's a screwup'
   The directing collective Traktor had another little difficulty
   immediately. "Since we're Swedish, we really don't know much about
   football," said Sam Larsson, one member of the collective. He and
   partner Patrik von Krusenstjerna had to look up who Terry Bradshaw was.

   The bigger challenge was convincing the audience that something unusual
   was happening. "To make the viewer actually believe this is happening
   for real, at least five or 10 seconds into the spot you have to have
   everyone actually stop and look at it and think, 'There's a screwup.
   Fox is actually doing some screwup,'" said Mr. Larsson.

   To protect that illusion, "every detail had to be absolutely perfect,"
   said Mr. Bichler. "This was going to be a massive team effort, both in
   the agency and the brand to do this. And that team had to grow a lot to
   include Fox and the NFL because they're both properties that are
   playing a role in this. We had to be able to simulate details
   immediately that really weren't even figured out yet, so we had to
   tackle that undertaking. And then present it on this immense, massive
   stage."

   Adding to the pressure was the absolute necessity to make the beginning
   indistinguishable from the real game booth. "When it's a Super Bowl
   spot, you know that everyone will not only look at it, they will
   actually dissect it," said Mr. von Krusenstjerna.

   Night filming
   The first part, filming Mr. Bradshaw and Jeffrey Tambor in a house in
   Altadena, Calif., went smoothly. But that kicked off a seven-day
   marathon shoot with deadlines increasingly bearing down. To preserve
   authenticity for the stain spot, P&G had to wait to see which four
   teams would make the playoffs so that the jerseys in the shot were
   correct.

   Actual filming began about three weeks prior to the Super Bowl. "That's
   pretty late," said Mr. Bichler. "That doesn't leave us a lot of time
   for some of the effects and some of the posts we are going to be able
   to do."

   And there were other hurdles. Because the actual game is played after
   dark, the scenes showing Mr. Bradshaw outside the stadium seeking to
   wash his shirt had to be filmed at night. "It's important that we can
   match the lighting of the Super Bowl," said Ms. Krehbiel. And above
   all, the set had to be credible. To make it so, the production team
   erected an enormous and painstakingly accurate replica of the Fox
   Sports broadcast booth on the football field at El Camino College in
   Torrance, Calif., and finally got ready to film with Mr. Bradshaw.

   And then came the rain.

   The set soaked, the team raced to break it down and reconstruct it
   inside a garage in the stadium. "We've had rain on shoots before, but
   on other shoots we had more flexibility," said Ms. Krehbiel. "We'd been
   able to move it to another day. But in this one, we've got the talent,
   we've got the puzzle, so everyone had to get creative. We had to move
   inside and use a green screen."

   The shot completed and the editing finally done, the team now had one
   jobâ€”to wait. "We hope the internet goes crazy," said Ms. Krehbiel in an
   interview before the game.

   And while, of course, the goal is to sell Tide, the plan was to
   entertain and amaze. "We hope it's something that takes people on a
   journey for a long period of time," she said, "and afterwards they look
   back and say, 'How did they do that?'â€‰"
