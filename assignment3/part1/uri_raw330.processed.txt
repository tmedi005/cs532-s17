   BOSTON (AP) — New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick has been
   added to a list of people who could be called to testify at the double
   murder trial of former player Aaron Hernandez.

   Belichick’s name appeared on a list of possible witnesses filed Tuesday
   by Hernandez’s defense.

   Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels had previously been named
   as a possible witness.

   Hernandez is charged with the drive-by slayings of Daniel de Abreu and
   Safiro Furtado in Boston in 2012. Prosecutors say Hernandez shot them
   after one spilled a drink on him at a club.

   Hernandez has pleaded not guilty.

   Jury selection is underway. Opening statements are scheduled March 1.

   Hernandez grew up in Connecticut. He’s serving a life sentence in the
   2013 killing of a man who was dating the sister of Hernandez’s fiancee.
