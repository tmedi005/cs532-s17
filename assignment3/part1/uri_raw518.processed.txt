Tom Brady Instagrams stolen Super Bowl shirt suspects

   Commentary: On Instagram, the New England Patriots quarterback accused
   quite a few people of potentially being involved.

   Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's
   taken over our lives.

   Perhaps it was a conspiracy among them all.

   When Tom Brady and justice come together, there's often consternation.

   The New England Patriots quarterback, so cruelly suspended by the NFL
   after being [133]accused of ordering balls to be deflated, is at the
   center of another crime against humanity.

   Immediately after his team's Super Bowl triumph earlier this month, the
   shirt he wore [134]disappeared. The jersey, now valued at $500,000, was
   allegedly taken by a mysterious person or persons.

   Could the Russians get hold of it and use it as a bargaining tool
   against Brady's good friend, Donald Trump? Stranger things have
   occurred.

   However, Brady himself has now [135]leaped to Instagram to offer his
   list of suspects. On Wednesday, he posted a whole police station
   collage of those who he fears might have been involved.

   These include Lady Gaga, she who performed in the halftime show. Also
   on the board, Jaws the shark who -- according to Brady -- "takes things
   without asking" and has a "violent history."

   There were even sci-fi suspects.

   "Guy who stole Khaleesi's egg," for example, a reference to a dreary TV
   show called "[139]Game Of Thrones." There was an even more familiar
   face: Gollum. Perhaps this legendary "Lord Of The Rings" character
   reflects Brady's own self-image, torn between love and hate.

   Another named suspect might confirm this: "Creepy Me." This person was
   the picture [140]a courtroom artist sketched of Brady as he testified
   during the Deflategate hearings.

   Naturally, Brady's post proved immensely popular, at time of writing
   enjoying more than 166,000 likes.

   Will it, though, help find those responsible? Or will the quarterback
   have another chip to bear on his delicate shoulders when next season
   begins?
