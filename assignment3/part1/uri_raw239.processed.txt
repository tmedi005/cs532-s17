New England Patriots: Final thoughts on season, Amendola close to pay cut

   Over the offseason there has been a buzz surrounding the free agents
   that may (or may not) be returning to New England for more rings. Danny
   Amendola is one of the bigger names on that list, but lucky for
   Patriots fans around the globe, it looks like Amendola [51]will
   agree to a pay cut. The incentive is to remain with the most powerful
   NFL franchise over the last 15 years.

   LI against the Atlanta Falcons at NRG Stadium. Mandatory Credit: John
   David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports

   Danny has had quite the offseason so far. The thirty-one year old Texas
   native accepted the third pay cut of his career, draft dodging another
   potential three year career turmoil (e.g. St.Louis). Danny also spent
   some time as a [53]runway model in the ever famous New York Fashion
   Week.

   But the biggest offseason buzz came from the [54]five-million dollar
   repentance fee that the league was forced to give Amendola and the rest
   of the justly-inflated league of legends. Amendola proved that
   somewhere between the broken glass pane of controversy in today’s NFL
   (cough: Darrelle Revis, Ray Rice, the Steelers version of deflategate,
   A.P., Shady McCoy’s 20-cent tip, the list goes on), there is still a
   level of personal decency in the league we’ve all had to love.

   In the wise words of Albert Brooks “The NFL owns a day of the week, the
   same day the church used to own. Now it’s theirs.” But it is our fault.
   We the People gave Sunday to a pack of money-grubbing New-York elitists
   who leak more than a pasta colander. I mean seriously, between the
   domestic violence scandals, lack of attention to medical issues like
   CTE and steroid usage, and the fact that [55]this toolbag made $35
   million last year, I would start a petition for Robert Kraft to start
   his own league. No Vince McMahon b.s. either.

   We need to stop treating the NFL like it has the same power as the MLB,
   because it doesn’t. The “commissioner” is a walking punch-line as well.
   Boo hoo, did a t-shirt [56]hurt your feelings, Rog? It is sad that
   Brady’s ever-growing trophy collection will never weigh up to the
   commish’s burnt ego.

   At this point what ammo does the NFL really have to hold on to? Regular
   season ratings are in the basement, the referees miss/over judge calls,
   and Pat McAfee retired in his prime to become a comedian. In other
   words, NFL executives should be more worried about internal
   difficulties than Matt Patricia’s wardrobe selections.

   In conclusion, Danny Amendola is a Patriot and an example for front-end
   exec’s and players throughout the league. The Patriots have shown time
   and again that hard work, selflessness, and loyalty, are the keys to
   success. With TB12 expected to play another six years and Coach
   Belichick invited to stick around as Head Coach and GM of the Patriots
   as long as he pleases, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Danny happily
   agree to return to Patriot Place, and many more of his New England
   brothers follow along in his contractual footsteps.
