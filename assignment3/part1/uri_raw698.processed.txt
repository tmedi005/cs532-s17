   King of All Athlete Social Media Tom Brady continued his GOAT-like
   streak with an Instagram post that gave a hilarious take on his Super
   Bowl 51 jersey, [35]which as of Wednesday afternoon is still
   missing and is valued at $500,000:

   [36]Hey @edelman11 "Ya suspect, yeah you! I don't know what your
   reputation is in this town, but after that s@?# you pulled, you can bet
   l'll be looking into you!"

   A post shared by Tom Brady (@tombrady) on Feb 22, 2017 at 8:39am PST

   That suspect board includes some funny and weird references: Lady Gaga
   (who performed at halftime of the Pats’ comeback win), teammate Julian
   Edelman and Lord of the Rings nemesis Gollum (because they “love
   rings”), Jaws, the Crab People from South Park and “Creepy Me” (the
   famous Brady [37]courtroom drawing that made headlines for being way
   off).

   Another command performance in the span of a month from the Patriots
   QB.

More NFL!
