Patriots: Trey Flowers returns as an anchor at defensive end, but questions
abound

   [AR-170229775.jpg&MaxH=225&MaxW=225]

   By Mark Daniels@MarkDanielsPJ

   With the 2016 season in the books, the Providence Journal will take a
   look at each position group on the Patriots, analyzing how the team
   performed in 2016 and where it might be heading in the future. Today we
   look at defensive end.

   Players: Trey Flowers, Jabaal Sheard, Rob Ninkovich, Chris Long, Geneo
   Grissom

   Contract situation: It looks like the Patriots have an anchor here, but
   they’re going to need to get younger and add some bodies to the
   defensive end position this season.

   Flowers is coming off the best year of his career and he enters 2017 on
   the third year of his rookie contract. He’s set to count for $754,733
   on the Patriots salary cap this season. The 23-year-old is signed
   through 2018 before becoming an unrestricted free agent in 2019.

   Beyond Flowers, there are a lot of questions.

   Ninkovich has one year left on his contract and he’s on the books for
   $2.250 million next season. At 33 years old, it wouldn’t be surprising
   if 2017 was the veteran’s last season in the NFL.

   Both Sheard and Long are unrestricted free agents. Long, 31, was
   noncommittal when The Providence Journal asked if he wanted to play
   next season. If he does, he wouldn’t cost the Patriots a lot to retain.
   Sheard is a different story. At 27 years old, he is in the prime of his
   career.

   Grissom is an exclusive rights free agent and likely to be back.

   2016 review: The season got off to a slow start for the Patriots edge
   rushers. With Ninkovich serving a four-game PED suspension, Sheard and
   Long started the season as the two defensive ends. The amount of
   quarterback sacks just wasn’t there consistently during the first half
   of 2016.

   That all changed thanks to Flowers. The second-year player amassed four
   sacks in two games and by Week 10, he was a starting defensive end.
   Flowers turned into the Patriots best pass rusher and finished with
   seven sacks — all made in the second half of the season. His ability to
   rush from the inside also gives the Patriots an advantage. He blew up
   in the Super Bowl, finishing with 2.5 sacks.

   Last season, it was mutually beneficial to have four defensive ends
   that could rotate in and out of each game.

   Ninkovich started opposite Flowers and finished with four sacks in 12
   games. Long also finished with four sacks, but his ability to get to
   the quarterback paid off in other ways. In Super Bowl LI, he drew a
   fourth-quarter holding penalty on Jake Matthews to help push the
   Falcons out of field-goal range. That was instrumental in the Patriots'
   comeback.

   Sheard had an up-and-down season. After making eight sacks last season,
   many thought he would replace Chandler Jones this past year. Instead,
   Sheard made headlines when the Patriots left him at home during their
   trip to San Francisco. The healthy scratch was notable. Sheard
   eventually got on the same page with his coaches, but finished with
   only five sacks this season.

   Grissom, a 2015 third-round pick, was cut at the end of training camp
   and started the season on the practice squad. He eventually made his
   way back on the 53-man roster and played 11 games this season — mainly
   contributing as a core special teamer (250 special team snaps). He
   played only 12 defensive snaps in 2016.

   The future: The Patriots need to get younger at defensive end. Luckily,
   they have Flowers to build around.

   That’s where it starts for the Patriots and at this point, Flowers
   looks like a rising star and could develop into the Patriots' best
   defensive player. The team needs to surround him with depth. Ninkovich
   brings great leadership, but isn’t getting any younger and can’t play
   every snap on defense.

   With Long and Sheard up for new contracts, it makes all the sense in
   the world for the Patriots to bring in another defensive end, or two,
   via the 2017 NFL Draft. If the Patriots could pair Flowers with another
   up-and-coming edge rusher, this defense would be primed for the long
   haul.

   It wouldn’t be shocking to see another team offer Sheard more money
   than the Patriots are willing to spend since edge rushers go for a
   premium price. The Pats could also try to bring Long back or another
   veteran, who is looking to win.

   The team could solve some issues if Grissom develops into the player
   they thought he could. After getting cut last summer, he’s anything but
   a guarantee in 2017.
