Tom Brady's first words to Patriots owner Robert Kraft in 2000 were so
accurate

   Published 11 hours ago Add your comment

   Football News
   24/7

   The New England Patriots have become one of the most dominant sports
   franchises in the world, and a large part of that is thanks to
   quarterback Tom Brady.

   The story behind Brady and his rise to stardom is well-documented, as
   he was a sixth-round draft pick who was widely overshadowed.
   Apparently, the quarterback didn't lack confidence when he came into
   the league, though, and Robert Kraft appeared on Real Sports with
   Bryant Gumbel to tell a pretty awesome story.

   According to [65]Will Brinson of CBS Sports, one of the first
   interactions that Kraft had with Brady was one that resulted in his son
   thinking the young QB was "cocky."

   Article continues below

     “I always remember him coming down the stairs at the old stadium. He
     said to me, ‘Hi, I’m Tom Brady.’ And he looked me in the eye and he
     said, ‘And I’m the best decision this organization has ever made.’”

   Kraft's son and Patriots president Jonathan Kraft was surprised by the
   comment, rightfully so.

     “I said, ‘God, really?’ I’m like, ‘Was he cocky?’ And my father said
     to me, ‘I’m telling you. There’s something about the way he said it
     that I believe him.'”

   And now, here we are five Super Bowls, four Super Bowl MVPs and two
   regular MVP awards later. What Brady said that day was pretty much spot
   on, and his most recent Super Bowl performance was just proof once
   again.

   Brady, who's set to turn 40 years old this offseason, may be on the
   tail end of his career, but he's still not showing any signs of slowing
   down. The man who's "the best decision" the Pats organization ever
   made, is still rolling right along, and there's real reason to believe
   he'll continue to add to his legacy.
