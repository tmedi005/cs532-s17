   Although it was quickly taken down, a banner reading “Refugees welcome”
   was put up on the base of the Statue of Liberty Tuesday afternoon by
   activists, sending a strong message to alleged president Donald Trump.
   Authorities do not know who is responsible the hanging banner.

   The stunning banner measures 3 feet by 20 feet. At around 12:50 p.m. it
   was unfurled atop the pedestal, according to National Park Service
   police.  It was in plain view, affixed to the outside of the public
   observation deck at the base of the statue by nylon rope, ABC[22]
   reports.

   Twitter user [23]@AltStatLiberty tweeted out a photo of the massive
   banner.

   Affixing signs to the Statue of Liberty or its pedestal is “strictly
   prohibited” and an investigation is underway to identify the people who
   placed the banner there, the National Park Service said.

   Trump’s immigration policy is chaotic, just like his presidency is. DHS
   officials told reporters that they were working on a plan to send
   migrants who had entered the United States from Mexico back to Mexico,
   even if they were not citizens of that country.

   Got that? They plan to send immigrants from other countries to Mexico.
   That little detail is [27]buried deep in the Trump administration’s
   plan to round up undocumented immigrants.

   It’s as if Trump wants a war [28]with Mexico:

     If present immigration trends continue, that could mean the United
     States would push hundreds of thousands of Guatemalans, Hondurans,
     Salvadorans, Brazilians, Ecuadorians, even Haitians into Mexico.
     Currently, such people are detained in the U.S. and allowed to
     request asylum.

   Meanwhile, Eric Trump has [29]requested permission for 23 foreign
   workers to work for his Virginia winery. Those workers are to plant and
   harvest grapes for his business. This, following Donald Trump’s promise
   to bring back jobs for U.S. citizens.

   Still left at the Statue of Liberty’s base is a plaque which reads,
   “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe
   free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the
   homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”
