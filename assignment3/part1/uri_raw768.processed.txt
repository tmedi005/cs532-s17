   Screen-Shot-2017-02-07-at-12.07.10-PM

   A 25-point lead seemingly evaporated out of thin air by arguably the
   greatest quarterback of all time, nearing the end of his career to
   obtain his fifth ring? It does sound improbable. Some thing too
   improbably.

   Super Bowl LI had such a mind-boggling, unbelievable outcome that fans
   are now taking to social media with their conspiracy theories,
   including this absurd one:

   cebook.com%2Fmzkellymac%2Fposts%2F10158421782685495&width=500

   In her caption, she explained –

   Did anyone else notice this moment?!? With 12:07 left on the OT clock
   this caption ran across the bottom of the screen! The game touch down
   didn’t happen until the clock was on 11:03. Can we say FIXED!!!!

   Sadly, she’s not alone. The post currently has 90,000 shares and
   thousands of comments agreeing with her, ironically about a graphic
   that’s put on screen to help clarify the rules to these very people.

     Turns out the [23]#SuperBowl is rigged.

   Other theories being used by Falcons fans includes that of [29]James
   White never reached the goal line on the play that won the game before
   his knee was down.

     THE SUPER BOWL IS SOOOO RIGGED LIKE ITS TOO OBVIOUS NOW .

     When I say Super Bowl u say rigged

     — misa (@Mariahssmith) [31]February 6, 2017

   Also, somehow, Donald Trump is involved in the outcome…

     The Super Bowl was rigged Tom Brady is Donald Trump favorite QB
