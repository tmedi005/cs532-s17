Third Quarter Drift Dings Super Bowl LI Ratings

   Just a few minutes after the second half of [140]Super Bowl LI got
   underway, the Atlanta Falcons appeared to have broken the backs of the
   New England Patriots. Matt Ryan's six-yard touchdown pass to Tevin
   Coleman put the birds up 28-3 over a Pats squad that looked out of sync
   and wholly ineffectual. Uunderstandably, fans began to tune out.

   While most viewers on Sunday night eventually found their way back to
   Fox as Tom Brady began to spearhead the single greatest comeback in
   Super Bowl history, the third quarter exodus -- preliminary results
   suggest that as many as 15 million viewers may have cycled out after
   the halftime show -- put a bit of a ding in the overall ratings.
   According to Nielsen fast national data, Super Bowl LI averaged 111.3
   million viewers on Fox, tying it with NBC's coverage of the Pats-Giants
   rematch of 2012 as the fourth most-watched NFL title tilt of all time.

   By comparison, last year's decidedly less explosive showdown between
   the Broncos and Panthers on CBS [141]delivered 111.9 million viewers.
   NBC continues to hold the record for the most-watched Super Bowl, as
   its coverage of the 2015 [142]New England-Seattle stunner averaged
   114.4 million viewers.

   While it is perhaps tempting to suggest that this year's ratings drop
   was a carryover from the NFL's regular-season woes, this assuredly was
   not the case. Whereas deliveries for the league's Sunday afternoon and
   various primetime slates fell 8% in 2016, this year's average Super
   Bowl draw was off less than 1% (0.5%, to be exact) compared to last
   season's Big Game and down just 2.7% versus the record-setting Super
   Bowl XLIX. That's a negligible decline, and one that's even less
   significant when streaming viewers and the Fox Deportes audience are
   factored in.

   Fold in streaming via the Fox Sports Go app and Deportes'
   Spanish-language viewers and Super Bowl LI's overall viewership
   averages out to 113.7 million fans, which makes the Pats-Falcons game
   the second most-watched American sporting event since the dawn of a)
   sports and b) broadcasting. As one might expect, the most-watched
   quarter coincided with [143]New England's overtime drive, as some 117.7
   million viewers were tuned in to Fox when Pats running back James White
   rumbled into the end zone from two yards out to put the game away for
   good.

   Per Nielsen, 172 million people watched at least some portion of Super
   Bowl LI, making it the most-watched program in the annals of TV.

   [144]Super Bowl ratings do not include out-of-home viewing, i.e.,
   deliveries in bars, restaurants, gyms, hotels and other public venues.

   With an average unit cost of around $5 million per 30-second spot, the
   cost of reaching 1,000 Super Bowl viewers (or CPM) was around $44.92,
   up just 4.7% compared to last year's $42.89.

   While the overall audience for Super Bowl was predictably huge, the
   broadcast drew the lowest household rating since 2010. According to
   Nielsen, Sunday's blockbuster averaged a 45.3 household rating, which
   simply means that a little more than 45% of the 118.4 million U.S. TV
   homes were tuned in to the game. That works out to 53.3 million homes.

   Super Bowl LI also notched a 70 share, which means that 70% of the TVs
   in use during the broadcast were tuned to Fox.

   No Super Bowl broadcast has ever topped a 50.0 household rating,
   although San Francisco's first taste of the Lombardi trophy, back in
   1982, came closest with a 49.1. The highest share of the active TV base
   was notched by the first Dallas-Pittsburgh classic, as Super Bowl X
   drew a 78 share.

   Among local markets, Atlanta (57.0) ranked third behind AFC strongholds
   Pittsburgh (57.9) and Buffalo (57.2), while Boston was eighth with a
   54.3 household rating.

   Of course, while it's aways nice to lay claim to a new ratings record,
   [145]Super Bowl ratings amount to little more than bragging rights. Not
   only are advertisers not provided a ratings guarantee, but the annual
   10% price hike is now so automatic that there is no longer a direct
   correlation between the year-ago deliveries and the rates set when the
   next network in line begins selling the Big Game.
