Wading in the Middle

The Upcoming Weeks in C7: February 21- March 3!

Humanities

   What: We are learning about the types of governments while looking at
   the social and economic changes in the 20th and 21st century.

   How: We are evaluating the driving question "How do we become agents of
   change?" Students will pick a country to research that has had a
   government overthrown in the last 117 years. They will learn about the
   previous type of government, the people who brought about change, and
   the government that was put in place. This should carry us through
   spring break.

   Why: It is important for students to learn about all the differences in
   the world. Students are learning about our country and how the
   government operates, but we also want them to be aware that other parts
   of the world do not operate like we do. This project will help students
   gain knowledge about people who have brought about change. Ultimately,
   it will help them shift their perspective to a global one.

   Note: We will be reading a class novel this spring. It will be The
   Giver by Lois Lowry. Please have this book for your learner by March
   27. We will begin the novel when we return from spring break. Also,
   reassessment forms are available in class for those wishing to reassess
   on a standard!

Life Science

   A look back...

   We have completed standard 7.5, and we took an assessment on the
   standard. Please look on Freshgrade for your learners' final
   assessment! We have also completed a "mummification" lab to see if the
   ancient the process of mummification would indeed stop decay. This has
   taken an unexpected turn and led us to study the Egyptian culture. We
   looked at how mummification was a result of the desert ecosystem, and
   we are using this branch to continue to see how ecosystems affect
   cultures.

   A look forward...

   We will be looking at how the ecosystems of the Sahara, the Nile, and
   the marshes helped shape the Egyptian culture. Specifically, we will be
   looking at the geography of Egypt, the religion, mummification process,
   and daily life of the people. The focus of this study will lead us into
   standard 7.8 on studying how organisms interact within ecosystems. The
   learners will be expected to demonstrate understanding of the following
   types relationships that occur within ecosystems.

   - Competition

   - Predation

   - Mutualism

   - Commensalism

   - Parasitism

   For students that require additional help with reassessment or have
   questions on classwork, I am opening up Tutoring each Tuesday morning
   from 7:30-8:00. Please have your learner pick up a pass from me on
   Monday if they wish to attend.

Decay Lab!

Math

   A Look Back...

   Rotations 1, 4 & 6 made progress towards their learning goals by
   finishing two-step inequalities and moving on to solving real life word
   problems. Learners completed many activities, group work, and some
   independent practice on Khan Academy. Rotation 3 finished up the
   standard 8.EE.6 on deriving the equation y=mx+b in multiple ways.
   Learners completed station activities outside, took a quiz, and also
   completed many various partner activities. Learners assessed Friday on
   the standard, and they will be uploaded to Fresh Grade next week.

   A look forward...

   Rotations 1, 4 & 6 will progress towards showing mastery in writing and
   solving two-step equations and inequality word problems. Learners will
   continue practicing through group activities, a scavenger hunt, and
   independent practice. Because next week is short, learners will assess
   the 2nd week. Rotation 3 will be introduced to the standard 8.EE.8
   solving systems of linear equations. Learners will work through some
   discovery activities learning different ways to solve systems of
   equations. Learners will also be working on a project about travel and
   implementing their own ideas.

   *Reminder: Tutoring is available every morning from 7:30-8am and every
   Tuesday & Thursday after school from 3:05-4pm.

   *Spiral Review: Homework will be given every Monday. The spiral review
   will be checked and reviewed every Wednesday and Friday. Please make
   sure your learner takes the necessary steps to complete the homework.

   *Reassessment: I have spoken to all students about the reassessment
   process which is the following:

   1. Fill out a reassessment form and bring it to a tutoring session

   2. Attend a tutoring session regarding that standard the student wants
   to reassess on

   3. Get the reassessment form approved by me, discussing a time and date
   to take the reassessment (if the student is ready).

   4. Take the reassessment.

   *Learners can only take one standard at a time to help learners focus
   on that standard. Any standard on Fresh Grade that can be moved up to
   Meeting Expectations I would recommend they follow the process!

Music Production

   The Recording Tech learners will explore the essential elements of
   technology used for making music, including a brief history of music
   technology in hardware, software, analog, and digital realms. Students
   will learn to utilize digital hardware and MIDI (Musical Instrument
   Digital Interface) sequencing technology to create and produce tracks
   of either the original or existing material using a music production
   workstation. The content includes creative production projects
   incorporating MIDI sequences using sampled sounds and synthesized
   modules with live overdubbing or acoustic instruments and utilization
   of sound processing equipment. We look forward to having an outstanding
   semester!
