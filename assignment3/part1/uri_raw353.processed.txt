Budweiser's 'Born the Hard Way' Super Bowl Ad Wins the Race for Online Video
Views

   Published on February 06, 2017.

   Budweiser's Super Bowl LI story of immigration "Born the Hard Way" has
   come from behind to accumulate the most online video views as of the
   morning after the game, according to Visible Measures. Before the game,
   Bud's campaign had ranked No. 5.

   Two marketers that didn't make [140]the top 10 on the Friday before the
   game are now on the list: Bud Light with its Spuds MacKenzie campaign
   and Tide, which did not pre-release its ad and has piled up views
   quickly since the game.

   This chart includes both paid views such as pre-roll ads and organic
   views initiated by viewers.

   Ad Age's Viral Video Chart, powered by Visible Measures, focuses on
   brand-driven social video ad campaigns. Each campaign is measured by
   [165]True Reach, an MRC accredited metric that includes views from
   brand-driven and audience-driven social video clips. The data are
   compiled using the patented Visible Measures platform, a constantly
   growing repository of analytic data on hundreds of millions of videos
   tracked across hundreds of online video destinations.
   Note: This analysis includes all publicly available video views on
   branded video content. This chart does not include movie trailers,
   video game campaigns, TV show, or television network promotions. View
   counts are incremental by week.
   To notify Visible Measures of an upcoming social video ad campaign,
   please [166]contact Visible Measures directly.
