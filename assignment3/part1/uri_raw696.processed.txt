Bill Belichick on witness list for second Aaron Hernandez murder trial

   Posted by Mike Florio on February 22, 2017, 10:52 PM EST
   HOUSTON, TX - FEBRUARY 05: Head coach Bill Belichick of the New England

   NRG Stadium on February 5, 2017 in Houston, Texas. (Photo by Al

   Patriot owner Robert Kraft [74]testified in the first Aaron Hernandez
   trial. Patriots coach Bill Belichick could testify in the second Aaron
   Hernandez trial.

   Via the Associated Press, Hernandez’s lawyers [75]have added Belichick
   to the list of possible witnesses. The head coach [76]joins offensive
   coordinator Josh McDaniels as persons who may take the oath and answer
   questions.

   The potential purpose of Belichick’s testimony isn’t known. Typically,
   lawyers pump up the list with an overly broad list of names in order to
   conceal the actual case strategy that would arise if the lawyers listed
   only the witnesses who actually will testify.

   Putting it another way, it’s like listing 20 players as “questionable”
   so that the other team won’t know who’s actually injured.

   Already convicted and serving life without parole for the June 2013
   shooting death of Odin Lloyd, Hernandez now stands trial for the July
   2012 murders of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado. Jury selection has
   begun, and opening statements are scheduled for March 1.
