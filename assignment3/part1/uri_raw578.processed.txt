Lessons of an entrepreneur, educator & executive

[46]On LinkedIn, The Super Bowl and Corporate Stock Valuations

   2/8/2016

   [47]0 Comments

   Mini-lesson On Stock Valuations
   I hope everyone who had boxes for Super Bowl Sunday won some money!
   Also, that everyone is on time for work this morning (apparently
   millions of Americans are late or call out on the Monday after Super
   Bowl…)

   LinkedIn got hit in the pocketbook this Friday after not meeting
   expectations. This led to their stock dropping more than 40%.  It was a
   bad day for LinkedIn but what does  this mean in the long term? In my
   opinion, I do not think there is another service / web site community
   that can replace LinkedIn.  I know there are other platforms out there
   but none that really provide the depth and breadth of content, job
   focused professionals like LinkedIn. (Blogger’s note: I am not a
   LinkedIn investor or spokesperson.)
   I do think the company will find its footing and its value – the market
   does not allow any bad news to pass by without making a dent.  As I
   discuss in my managerial finance courses, valuation of a public company
   and the idea that stock prices should be at "equilibrium" representing
   the true value of the company is basically an impossibility.
   Everything is based on expectations, perceptions and the version of the
   spin we get from various companies. Like with Yahoo right now there is
   so much being discussed around corporate decisions, parties and layoffs
   – but the true idea of what goes on in a large company behind its doors
   and in every cubicle is a mystery at times to even those inside said
   company.

   To help demonstrate this, I like to tell my students the story about my
   experiences at a large multinational corporation (MNC). (I tell stories
   a lot as part of my teaching style; it helps keep the textbook
   information interesting by relating it to real-life experiences and it
   has served me well for my lesson-based seminars, speaking engagements
   and training sessions.)
   My story is from when I was part of one division with a large MNC and
   thought the division was its own company. I mean, I was young and
   stupid but not that young and stupid I did realize there were other
   “parts” of the company but really thought we were a stand-alone entity.
   I thought this way until I was promoted up the ranks into another
   division of said company and began to meet with the actual CEO and CFO
   of the whole corporation. All of a sudden, I became aware of the fact
   that we all were one company and yet no one and I mean no one really
   knew what the other sides were doing. We had projects being replicated
   across divisions and corporate was trying to uncover these instances so
   that we could negotiate corporate pricing and not division 1 pays so
   much and division 2 pays an additional so much. It was like being a
   detective or a spy. So many things were done in so many ways and some
   of it sneakily to avoid full reporting. For example, project over $5m
   had to go through hoops and ladders to be approved so many projects
   were $4.9m.
   The point is that as much as everyone tried to get a full picture at
   the C-suite and below, it was very hard. So when it came to reviewing
   financials, every sector / department rolled up their numbers until it
   got to the top – did any one person understand every one thing going on
   in this huge company? It would be an impossible feat to even know a
   fraction of everything that was going on in said company and yet this
   is how all large companies are – it is the nature of the beast. In
   fact, I would argue any company over 20-100 people will potentially
   also now have an absolute 100% clear picture into what every person is
   doing/working on. Multiply that by orders of magnitude with a company
   with thousands of people and the fact that some people are disingenuous
   and you can have disaster and/or hidden minefields everywhere. We were
   told by the CFO that every time we launched a project and mis-spent x
   amount of dollars that it would take x amount of cents off earnings per
   share (EPS) and this would be disastrous for the stock price. It really
   was a powerful statement and whenever I tell my students about it we
   ruminate on how these dollar amounts really impact stock price and what
   that means to a corporation.

   So valuation of corporations is a challenge but missing a profit number
   or an EPS amount is something that will send stock price falling
   especially in an economy that is struggling. I am assuming LinkedIn
   will get back into the right track as they overall had an awesome 2015.
   More and more professionals, hiring managers and more are using
   LinkedIn as a way to find talent and to recruit future employees.
   Having an awesome profile on LinkedIn can get you in the door at many
   companies for an interview faster than any other way. I will say that I
   have been sought after as a service provider by clients who see what I
   am doing on LinkedIn AND I have been sought after by other professional
   organizations for my content and training programs and more via my work
   on LinkedIn – or just by sharing the work I am doing via my blog and
   YouTube to LinkedIn.
   LinkedIn Tips:
   There is a lot of value in this website and this community, if you know
   how to use it. It is NOT Facebook as the popular meme going around
   LinkedIn says – but just posting that meme kind of shows you are not
   sure that LinkedIn is NOT Facebook (oh the irony). If you try to apply
   some of my tips, you can find yourself being sought after on LinkedIn,
   too.

   For more help and information, check out my product page I over a
   complete LinkedIn profile overhaul along with detailed personalized
   lessons and instructions on how you can implement your new Next Step
   profile for $150 or I am now doing value bundle of resume, cover
   letters and LinkedIn overhaul for $300. I put in at least 8-10 hours of
   work into every LinkedIn profile I redesign and I do redesign and
   recreate it to the point that it becomes a better version of your
   resume, it is interactive, available and always online for recruiters
   and potential hiring managers to see – order yours today here:

   Rules:
    1. Have an awesome eye catching summary; put in the important stuff
       here. If you are certified in something, put it here. If you are
       taking exams to BE certified, you can mention it here (mainly only
       if you are confident you will achieve the certification).
    2. Your jobs and the description of your duties should be on point and
       highlight the best of what you can do – real action and results.
    3. You should solicit endorsements as much as possible; also endorse
       others so they will endorse you.
    4. Request recommendations and provide recommendations, too.
    5. Be careful what / how you post and interact on LinkedIn – remember
       it is not Facebook!

   social media channels! Happy Hunting!
