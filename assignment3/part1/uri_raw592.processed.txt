Superbowl Tuning 2017

   February 22, 2017
   Shannon Schafer

   This year’s Superbowl tuning was interesting from a media standpoint
   for a number of reasons. While it’s always among the highest viewed
   programs of the year, Superbowl 51 represented the first non-simulcast
   broadcast, meaning Canadians were watching US commercials rather than
   Canadian commercials as we have in past years.

   In addition to this year’s game not being simulcast, reports are
   showing that tuning overall is down by 30% . The TV numbers peaked at
   5.138 million over halftime, which is typical. During the game itself,
   audience levels started slow at 4.020M, growing each quarter (Q2 4.321M
   & Q3 4.309M) and ending with 4.662M in the fourth quarter.  It’s safe
   to say that digital tuning was strong, and also peaked during Lady
   Gaga’s half time show. A drop of 30% is a pretty big deal from a
   broadcaster perspective in terms of audience compensation and
   makegoods, not to what it means for renewals for the Canadian broadcast
   of the NFL games and Superbowl in the future.

   While buying spots in next year’s Superbowl likely won’t be an option
   due to the lack of simulcast, there are still options available for
   advertisers who are seeking this audience.  Among our top
   recommendations would be to explore options within the digital
   broadcast, or potentially look at sponsorship options outside of
   traditional :30 inventory.  For those with big hearts and small
   budgets, it doesn’t cost anything to become a part of the conversation
   on social media around the game, the commercials, and for those of us
   who are media geeks, the audience tuning numbers.
