The Kansas City Chiefs might be in the market for a new starting quarterback
at some point in the very near future, but Jimmy Garoppolo makes absolutely
no sense for KC.

   It’s the NFL offseason, so rumors are supposed to be flying this time
   of year. The Kansas City Chiefs are rumored to be considering changes
   at the starting quarterback position, which makes them ripe to be
   connected with anyone and everyone. However, one idea floating about
   the possibility of trading for Jimmy Garoppolo is among the ones that
   make the least amount of sense.

   Garoppolo has certainly looked the part as a potential starting
   quarterback in limited duty filling in for Tom Brady the last few
   seasons. Since Bill Belichick made Garoppolo a second round pick in
   2014, Garoppolo has thrown only 94 total passes (that’s two weeks work
   for Drew Brees, by comparison), but Garoppolo went 2-0 when starting
   while Brady was suspended in 2016, completing 68% of his passes and
   throwing 4 touchdowns and avoiding any interceptions. It was good for a
   113.3 passer rating and plenty of buzz about his starting potential.

   Garoppolo basically has it all going for him at this point. Let’s
   consider the following:

   1. One third of NFL franchises seem to be desperate for a long-term
   answer at quarterback, the game’s most important position.
   2. Teams are paying through the nose to find those answers (a la Brock
   Osweiler’s mega-contract from the Houston Texans).
   3. There’s an ongoing mystique around Bill Belichick’s players and
   staff that make them seem better than they are (a la every former Pats
   player and coach who leaves).
   4. The limited sample size looks great
   5. He’s studied under both the best quarterback and coach in NFL
   history.
   6. He’s ready to start from Week 1 versus a rookie who might need time.

   In short, there’s a lot to like about Garoppolo for any team in need of
   a starter. And that’s where this all begins to fall apart when viewed
   from the Chiefs perspective. The cost is going to be far too
   considerable both in trade value and in contract terms for the Chiefs
   to take the bait.
