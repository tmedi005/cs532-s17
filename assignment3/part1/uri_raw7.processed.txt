   Much of the blame for the Falcons’ monumental choke job in Super Bowl
   51 [34]fell on Kyle Shanahan for his aggressive play-calling, and
   that’s fair. It’s screamingly obvious Atlanta should have run the ball
   more or milked the clock to keep Tom Brady and the Patriots from even
   having a chance to storm all the way back. But this easy analysis
   elides the fact that New England’s defense still had to stop Atlanta
   several times in the game’s final 17 minutes.

   How did the Pats do it, after giving up three scoring drives in the
   first half-plus? They dialed up a few more five- and six-man blitzes,
   but by and large they stuck with the script they had used for much of
   the game. And on what Bill Belichick himself [35]described as the
   game’s “key play”—Dont’a Hightower’s strip-sack of Matt Ryan, which
   gave the Pats a short field from which to make it a one-score game—the
   Patriots took advantage of a simple breakdown in execution by Atlanta.

   “Too aggressive? No. I thought Kyle did a good job,” [36]Ryan said of
   Atlanta’s play-calling. “I thought we played the way that we play. We
   always play aggressive and play to win and we had opportunities as
   players.” There is truth to what Ryan said, and in a parallel universe
   where one single block was made, the World Champion Falcons would now
   be getting praised for going for the Patriots’ throats.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ryan played a terrific game throughout. In the first half, he posted a
   perfect passer rating. For the game as a whole, he finished with a
   passer rating of 144.1, the [37]best by a losing quarterback in Super
   Bowl history, and the fourth-best by any quarterback in a Super Bowl,
   win or lose. The Falcons’ offense was historically good throughout the
   regular season and the playoffs, and yet Ryan’s Super Bowl yards per
   attempt (12.35) and adjusted yards per attempt (14.09) were better than
   all but two other games he played all year. And he did this even as the
   Patriots were in his face all night. Gauging what constitutes pressure
   on a quarterback can be subjective, but Greg Bedard of Sports
   Illustrated estimated that Ryan [38]saw pressure on 53.6 percent of his
   dropbacks, while [39]Pro Football Focus had the number at [40]57.1
   percent. Either way, it was a lot.

   Throughout the game, the Pats moved players in their front seven.
   Hightower may be listed as a middle linebacker, but he frequently lined
   up against the Falcons on the outside. And on defensive end Trey
   Flowers’ ginormous fourth-quarter sack—the one in that crucial sequence
   in which Atlanta [41]went 23 yards backward—Flowers was lined up on the
   inside and simply ran past right guard Chris Chester. It was only
   Chester’s third play after Ryan Schraeder had gone down with an ankle
   injury, and Chester’s mistake left center Alex Mack, playing on a
   broken leg, hopelessly chasing Flowers into the backfield:

   GIF

   And while it’s true the Falcons should have run the ball more—Shanahan
   inexplicably called just four(!) running plays after Atlanta built a
   28-3 lead—Flowers also had [42]two giant run stops in short-yardage
   situations.[43]* Late in the third quarter, he brought down Coleman for
   a 1-yard loss on second-and-1. And on second-and-2 on the play before
   Hightower forced Ryan to fumble, he assisted with Logan Ryan to limit
   Coleman to a one-yard gain.

   But New England got pressure on Ryan from the very beginning. Here, on
   the Falcons’ second possession of the game, Hightower got a quick first
   step to put left tackle Jake Matthews on his heels. Hightower then used
   his hands to get past Matthews and into Ryan’s face. The play resulted
   in a quick completion to fullback Patrick DiMarco that went for a first
   down, but it was a sign of what was to come.

   GIF

   Flowers had a third-down sack on Atlanta’s first possession. And
   defensive lineman Alan Branch got another one on third down the second
   time the Falcons had the ball. Watch how the Patriots went with a
   zone-blitz look by having six defenders at the line of scrimmage before
   dropping three into coverage at the snap:
   [gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==]
   [gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==]
   GIF

   It was that coverage that forced Ryan into holding the ball, stepping
   up in the pocket, and right to where Branch could get at him. No one
   was open:

   [gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==]
   GIF

   On the first possession of the second half, the Patriots got off the
   field on third down when cornerback Eric Rowe broke up a short pass
   along the sideline intended for Taylor Gabriel. But Pats defensive end
   Chris Long overpowered Matthews and hit Ryan as he delivered his throw:

   [gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==]

   [gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==]
   GIF

   Later in the third quarter, watch as defensive end Jabaal Sheard flew
   around the edge to pressure Ryan into making a running throw that was
   dropped by tight end Austin Hooper:
   [gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==]
   [gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==]
   GIF

   On the next play, the Pats brought a five-man blitz, with linebacker
   Kyle Van Noy looping into a stunt that allowed him and Flowers to
   eventually get to Ryan. Ryan may have wanted to throw to running back
   Tevin Coleman in the flat, but safety Patrick Chung immediately
   recognized where Coleman was headed and was there waiting for him:
   [gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==]
   [gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==]
   GIF

   PFF said the Pats only blitzed Ryan eight times, or 28.5 percent of his
   dropbacks, which was just below the league’s regular-season average of
   30.5 percent. But as NFL.com’s Bucky Brooks [44]noted, several of New
   England’s blitzes came in the second half, likely out of desperation to
   make something happen.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Let’s return to the Falcons’ missed opportunity to put things away. The
   Pats also ran a five-man loop-stunt blitz on the game-defining play
   that resulted in Hightower’s strip sack. And there was one more wrinkle
   added by defensive coordinator Matt Patricia: Hightower rushed [45]from
   the left side, rather than from the right, as he had been doing
   earlier. As Patricia said, per The Wall Street Journal:

     “It was a call in the game plan in that situation that we might want
     to use. It was a little bit of a change up for that particular part
     of the field. It was a great job of disguise [by Hightower] in
     getting out there.”

   And here we can see that it was running back Devonta Freeman completely
   whiffing on Hightower that made the play possible. This was the pivotal
   play of the game.

   GIF

   Why did Ryan not see Hightower? Probably because he had his eyes
   downfield and was about to uncork a deep throw to Taylor Gabriel, who
   had smoked Malcolm Butler and was wide open for what would have been a
   game-clinching touchdown. “We thought,” Falcons head coach Dan Quinn
   [46]would say later, “that was the opportunity to let it rip.” In the
   hindsight of everything that happened to the Falcons, that might seem
   ridiculous. But the opportunity really was there:
   [gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==]
   [gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==]
   GIF

   Remember, Julio Jones was only targeted four times all night because
   the Patriots bracketed him with two defenders. On the Hightower sack,
   Devin McCourty was the high safety, and McCourty trailed Jones across
   the middle, leaving Gabriel one on one with Butler. Gabriel used an
   inside-out move to blow by Butler, and he was two steps past him by the
   time Hightower got to Ryan. And Ryan was definitely winding up to get
   Gabriel the ball:
   [gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==]
   [gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==]
   GIF

   “I’m not sure we could have won without that play,” Belichick [47]said.
   “Without that,” Belichick [48]also said, “I don’t know if we’d have
   enough possessions or could get it done quick enough.” Which is
   correct. The Patriots needed many, many plays to break exactly as they
   did. That baffling [49]minus-23 sequence included a sack, a hold, and
   an incomplete pass, right when three runs and a field goal would have
   put the game out of reach. But the Patriots did their thing, too, just
   as they had been doing all night, and they made the Falcons pay dearly
   for one player’s lack of execution on Ryan’s fumble. Tom Brady did the
   rest.
