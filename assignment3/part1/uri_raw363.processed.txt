   The New England Patriots will look to defend their Super Bowl title in
   2017. But first, they have some questions to answer.

   Before the NFL Scouting Combine kicks off next week, marking the
   unofficial start of the NFL offseason, we’re taking a
   position-by-position look at the Patriots’ roster. We’ll examine which
   players stood out in 2016, which ones have some work to do this
   offseason and which ones could be leaving town.

   Next up: the wide receivers.

   UNDER CONTRACT
   Julian Edelman
   Chris Hogan
   Malcolm Mitchell
   Danny Amendola
   Matthew Slater
   Devin Lucien (practice squad)

   IMPENDING FREE AGENTS
   Michael Floyd

   STANDOUT PERFORMER
   Edelman was the unquestioned top dog of the Patriots’ deep and talented
   receiving corps, a billing he lived up to this season. His 1,106
   receiving yards were a career high, his 98 receptions were his most
   since 2013, and both of those stats led the team by a wide margin.

   What made Edelman truly invaluable, though, was his production after a
   back injury relegated star tight end Rob Gronkowski [49]to injured
   reserve. Edelman racked up a ridiculous 831 yards on 55 catches over
   New England’s final eight games (including playoffs) and went over 100
   yards receiving in four of those contests.

   Oh, and there also was [50]that catch he made in Super Bowl LI, which
   you might have seen once or twice by now.

   ide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   Honorable mention goes to Hogan, who emerged as the Patriots’ most
   dangerous deep threat in years while finishing tied for the NFL lead in
   yards per catch (17.9).

   NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
   Amendola made some clutch catches for the Patriots this season and
   [52]had a monster game in the Super Bowl. But overall, it was a
   disappointing campaign for the 31-year-old, who caught just 23 passes
   during the regular season and missed four games with a high ankle
   sprain.

   Given his lofty $7.79 million salary cap hit for 2017 — the
   fourth-highest on the team — it’s extremely unlikely Amendola sticks
   around unless he agrees to restructure his contract for a third time.

   BY THE NUMBERS
   124: The number of times quarterback Tom Brady targeted Edelman over
   the final 10 weeks of the season (i.e. after Gronkowski went down), by
   far the most of any Patriots pass-catcher. Second on that list was
   running back James White with 60 targets.

   11: The number of times Brady targeted Amendola in Super Bowl LI. Brady
   threw his way just 29 times during the entire regular season.

   BIGGEST OFFSEASON STORYLINES
   1. Will Amendola restructure? There’s almost no chance the Patriots
   will pay him the $6 million salary he’s owed next season. If he doesn’t
   agree to a pay cut — which he reportedly [53]is open to doing — New
   England likely will be forced to release him.

   2. Will Floyd be back? The former Arizona Cardinal didn’t make much of
   an impact outside of his explosive Week 17 showing in Miami and was
   inactive for both the AFC Championship Game and the Super Bowl. He also
   currently is [54]serving a jail sentence for the December DUI that
   prompted the Cardinals to waive him. The 27-year-old will be out in
   time for training camp, however, and given his recent off-the-field
   issues, it seems likely the Patriots would be able to re-sign him to an
   affordable one-year contract if they so choose. For what it’s worth,
   Floyd said during Super Bowl week he [55]wants to remain in New
   England.

   3. Will the Patriots extend Edelman? The highly productive wideout is
   signed through this coming season, but he’s set to hit free agency in
   2018 and should be in line for a major pay raise once he does.
   Edelman’s 2017 cap hit of $5.75 million [56]ranks 30th among all wide
   receivers, according to Spotrac, and New England could look to lock him
   up long-term with a contract extension this offseason.
