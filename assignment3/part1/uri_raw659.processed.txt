   If you spent Sunday night tuning into Super Bowl 51, then you probably
   donʼt need us to tell you that [27]Lady Gaga nailed her Halftime Show
   performance. And while high-flying tricks and plenty of pyrotechnics
   werenʼt even enough to overshadow the pop starʼs set, we couldnʼt help
   but steal more than a few glances at the glittery makeup look that
   served as a perfect complement to Gagaʼs [28]even more glittery Versace
   leotards.

   Gagaʼs makeup artist [29]Sarah Tanno was inspired by her clientʼs
   dynamite career, and for Gagaʼs most explosive appearance yet
   (literally) sought to take her beauty look to new heights. "I wanted
   her to be able to look at this 10 years from now and have it feel
   timeless," said Tanno via press release. Beginning by swiping [30]Marc
   Jacobs Beauty Twinkle Pop Stick in Au Revoir, a soft pewter shimmer,
   Tanno then defined the eye with a creamy pencil liner in a shade of
   dark violet to add definition while keeping things in the same color
   family. Next, a series of darker shades of purple served as contrast
   to softer lavenders and pink shades used from the [31]Marc Jacobs
   Beauty Style Eye Con palettes in The Tease, The Lover and [32]About
   Last Night.

   And because no Lady Gaga makeup look would be complete without her
   signature heavy cat-eye, Tanno glided a pure onyx pencil all along the
   lash line to create the winged shape before sealing it with a heavy
   dose of liquid liner. Several coats of [33]Marc Jacobs Beauty Velvet
   Noir Mascara on the top lashes and editor-favorite [34]Feather Noir
   Mascara along the bottom lashes completed the look.

   As for the red lip seen from the very top of NRG Stadium? [35]Marc
   Jacobs Beauty Le Marc Lip Crème Lipstick in Dashing, topped with a
   fuchsia gloss. And that, friends, is a touchdown look if we ever saw
   one.
