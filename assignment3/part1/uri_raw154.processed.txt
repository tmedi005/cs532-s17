Buick Super Bowl Ad Criticized for Vehicles Not Made in U.S.

   By [139]John Irwin. Published on February 06, 2017.

   Buick's Super Bowl commercial has drawn the ire of the UAW.

   Cindy Estrada, the director of the UAW's [140]General Motors
   department, signaled her displeasure with the commercial on Twitter
   Sunday night. The ad showcased the 2017 Encore crossover, assembled in
   South Korea, and the Cascada convertible, built in Poland.

   "Can't believe GM would feature foreign made vehicles on all-American
   Super Bowl," Ms. Estrada tweeted Sunday night.

     Can't believe GM would feature foreign made vehicles on all-American
     Super Bowl [141]@UAW
     — Cindy Estrada (@CindyEstrada174) [142]February 6, 2017

   The 60-second Buick spot, which ran during the first quarter of the
   game, featured Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton and supermodel
   Miranda Kerr. The ad was handled by Publicis Groupe's EngageM-1.

   A Buick spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment Monday
   afternoon.

   The ad came as President Donald Trump has repeatedly called on U.S.
   automakers to build more of their vehicles domestically, threatening to
   slap tariffs on vehicles built outside the U.S.

   Like Trump, the UAW has criticized U.S. trade policy over the past
   several decades, calling free trade deals such as the North American
   Free Trade Agreement unfair to American workers who have seen
   high-paying jobs shifted to Mexico and other lower-wage nations.

Super Bowl LI Ad Review: Facing a Big Moment, Enough Marketers Find Their
Footing

   Automakers have responded to the pressure put on them by announcing new
   investments and jobs at U.S. plants. Automakers have framed the
   investments as reflections of the strength of the U.S. economy and
   confidence in the Trump administration's economic policies, though many
   of the investments have been in the works for years.

   Buick chose to showcase the Cascada and Encore in its ad this year
   because they are the brand's leading conquest models, Buick marketing
   director Molly Peck told Automotive News last week.

   "We'll connect with people who like sports, who like Cam Newton," Ms.
   Peck said. "We'll connect with people who just like advertising during
   the game."

   Buick sold 5,258 Encores in the U.S. in January, up 6.9% from a year
   earlier, according to the Automotive News Data Center. It sold 312
   Cascadas, up from 88 in 2016.

   John Irwin is reporter at Automotive News. His colleague Vince Bond
   contributed to this report.
