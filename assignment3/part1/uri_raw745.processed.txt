New England “should sign” Titans DT, while 5 Patriots could land elsewhere

   [48]New, [49]22 comments

The Patriots are going to be at the center of free agency.

   The [56]New England Patriots are going to be at the heart of free
   agency by virtue of winning [57]the Super Bowl. Teams are always going
   to pay extra for players that were a part of the reigning champions and
   the Patriots have a long list of key players about to hit the market.

   With this is mind, [58]Pro Football Focus decided to match one free
   agent- both restricted and unrestricted- with one new team in order to
   create the best match for both sides.

   While the Patriots have a lot of sexy names, PFF gives the Patriots a
   player that finished the season on the injured reserve- but one that
   could really help out the team’s pass rush:

     [59]Karl Klug, DL | Position rank: 22nd

     The Super Bowl LI champions love to tap into the veteran market to
     fill holes along the defensive line, and Klug brings the versatility
     they covet up front. Klug is capable of playing on the interior or
     the edge while producing in multiple fronts, and he's an efficient
     pass-rusher, finishing at 78.3 [PFF grade] in that department last
     season with the [60]Titans. Klug hasn't played more than 400 snaps
     since his rookie season in 2011, but he's a valuable addition as a
     rotational piece with the ability to rush the passer from multiple
     positions.

   The 6’3, 275 pound defensive lineman was originally drafted as a
   defensive end in the 5th round of the 2011 [61]NFL Draft out of the
   University of Iowa. He has racked up 20 sacks in six seasons as a
   defensive tackle and is a strong run defender, despite his size.

   Klug could easily slide into the [62]Trey Flowers- or Dominique
   Easley-type role in the Patriots defense as a 4-technique defensive
   tackle in the Patriots base defense and as a nose tackle in the 3-man
   front on passing downs. He could rotate with [63]Flowers to give the
   rising star a breather, and would also allow Flowers to play more on
   the edge to help mitigate a potential loss of [64]Chris Long or
   [65]Jabaal Sheard in free agency.

   Klug is in the middle of recovering from an Achilles injury, but older
   players like [66]Vince Wilfork and [67]Cameron Wake have returned from
   the same injury to perform at their level. Klug suffered his injury in
   December and should be ready to play in September.

   While the Patriots should look at bolstering their defensive front,
   five Patriots- past and present- represent the ideal free agent for
   teams around the league.

[68]Baltimore Ravens

     Jabaal Sheard, DL | Position rank: 36th

     The Ravens aren't fortunate enough to have much salary-cap room, so
     even if some of the top pass-rushers hit the open market, it's
     unlikely Baltimore will be in position to make a big splash for
     them. What does make sense, though, is adding a veteran pass-rusher
     to bolster a defense that saw just one player, [69]Terrell Suggs,
     register at least eight sacks and 45 total hurries in 2016. Sheard
     will be 28 years old when the 2017 season begins, and he registered
     six sacks, six hits and 31 hurries on 380 pass-rushing snaps
     (including the playoffs) for the Patriots in 2016. He is just a year
     removed from registering 65 total pressures on 397 pass-rushing
     snaps, so he can definitely help the Ravens in an area of need.

   Sheard could end up back in the AFC North after starting his career in
   Cleveland and could be a nice fit in the Ravens defensive front.
   Sheard’s value is lower than it was at the end of 2015, but perhaps a
   team will pay the pass rusher based off his previous potential instead
   of his 2016 performance.

[70]Cleveland Browns

     [71]Chandler Jones, LB | Position rank: 7th

     With more cap room than any other team in the NFL, the time for the
     Browns to make a splash in free agency is now. What better way to
     make that splash than to go after the top pass-rusher on the market?
     The fifth-year veteran has registered at least 15 quarterback
     knockdowns (sacks and hits) every season since he entered the
     league, and that number jumps to 22 when looking at the past two
     seasons alone. He registered 66 total pressures on 565 snaps, which
     works out to a pressure once every 8.6 pass-rushing attempts.
     [72]Jones is almost certain to stay in Arizona -- either on [73]the
     franchise tag or a long-term deal -- but Cleveland should jump at
     the chance to sign him if he makes it to the market.

   The [74]Cardinals have made it clear that they’re not going to let
   Jones walk, but the Browns are totally the team that could pay
   mega-millions to swipe Jones and pair him with his former teammate LB
   [75]Jamie Collins.

[76]Oakland Raiders

     Dont'a Hightower, LB | Position rank: 12th

     Even after a spending spree last offseason, the Raiders have a ton
     of cap space and can use it to address easily their biggest position
     of need: linebacker. The cream of the crop this year in free agency
     is easily Hightower, as he has been a top-10-graded linebacker for
     PFF each of the past three seasons for New England. The most
     impressive facet of Hightower's game comes as a blitzer. He has
     racked up 18 sacks the past three years, while the Raiders' off-ball
     linebackers didn't have a single one in 2016. Hightower will likely
     return to the Patriots, but he'll have many suitors if he makes it
     to the open market.

   The Patriots shouldn’t let Hightower walk and have more cap space than
   the Raiders to play with. Still, Hightower could bolster a young
   Raiders team that is looking to make a push in the AFC, while weakening
   the Patriots.

[77]Chicago Bears

     [78]Logan Ryan, CB | Position rank: 16th

     Chicago at heart loves physical cornerbacks who will play the run
     and make an impact, and Ryan is a fantastic representation of that.
     He had the league's third-best run-stop percentage among all
     cornerbacks, at 2.6 percent of run snaps, and the 24 defensive stops
     he notched over the regular season for the Patriots were fourth best
     at the position. Ryan won't ever be an All-Pro corner, but he can be
     a solid starting option for a team that needs an overhaul at
     cornerback.

   The market for Ryan will be bigger than many expect because Ryan
   represents a lot of impressive qualities for a corner. He can stop the
   run. He has ball skills. He can play on the sideline and in the slot.
   He can go toe-to-toe with and even erase the best receivers in the
   league (if given safety help). He might not be a #1 cornerback, but
   you’ll struggle to find a better complementary #2 corner.

Arizona Cardinals

     [79]Martellus Bennett, TE | Position rank: 10th

     For a team that uses a tight end as such a crucial part of its
     offense, the Cardinals might want to fix the revolving door of
     inadequacy that they've managed in recent years. For Arizona, it's a
     blocking-first position, and New England's Bennett has been one of
     the top blocking tight ends over the course of his career. The
     journeyman also adds some playmaking ability after the catch, as he
     led the league in broken tackles in 2013 and 2014.

   The tea leaves are pointing to a departure for Bennett at a price the
   Patriots can’t match and the Cardinals have always been aggressive at
   getting the players they want to sign.

   Clearly this isn’t how free agency will play out and it’s just an
   exercise in matching players with teams, but I was still surprised that
   RFA CB [80]Malcolm Butler was not listed. The [81]Eagles are slotted
   RFA WR [82]Adam Thielen, so leaving Butler off is pretty curious.

   [83]Looking at the free agents of other teams, who do you want the
   Patriots to sign?
