Report: Patriots’ Bill Belichick may have to testify at Aaron Hernandez’s
trial

   Jesse Borek
   By [83]Jesse Borek
   Posted on Feb 22, 2017
   [INS: :INS]

   New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick [84]may be called to
   testify at former tight end Aaron Hernandez’s double murder trial if
   his name is chosen off the defense’s witness list. Offensive
   coordinator Josh McDaniels is also mentioned on the same list, as the
   defense prepares their witnesses in a 2012 case in which Hernandez has
   been charged with a double homicide in a drive-by shooting.  Hernandez
   is currently serving a life sentence since 2015 for the killing of Odin
   Lloyd.

   Belichick was the only head coach Hernandez had in his three seasons in
   the NFL. The Patriots (and largely Belichick) drafted him in the fourth
   round of the 2010 NFL Draft out of Florida, despite reports that he had
   failed multiple drug tests while in college.

   His best season came in 2011, when the Patriots unleashed the tandem of
   Hernandez and fellow tight end Rob Gronkowski in two-tight end
   packages, with Hernandez catching 79 passes for 910 yards and seven
   touchdowns. The duo own the single-season record for receptions,
   receiving yards, and touchdowns for tight end teammates. For his
   career, Hernandez finished with 175 catches for 1,956 yards and 18
   touchdowns over 38 games, all of which came under Belichick.

   Hernandez would not make it to his fourth NFL season, where he was set
   to begin cashing in on the $40 million contract extension he had
   received from New England. He was charged with first-degree murder in
   June, before being found guilty in April 2015 and sentenced to life
   imprisonment.

   The case that Belichick (and McDaniels) would be asked to testify at
   represents another case entirely, one in which Hernandez is on trial
   for a double homicide.
