[72]Dolphins sign Dan Marino to 1-day contract

   [73]Associated Press Wednesday, February 22, 2017

   FILE - In this April 29, 2014 file photo, Miami Dolphins Hall of Fame
   quarterback Dan Marino speaks to reporters about the Pro Football Hall
   of Fame fanjets at the I-X Center in Cleveland. Marino is re-signing
   with the Dolphins, Wednesday, Feb. 22, 2017, in order to officially
   retire as a member of the franchise. The Dolphins are signing six
   players for retirement purposes: Marino, Larry Little, Sam Madison, Bob
   Griese, Kim Bokamper and Nat Moore. AP Photo)
   [74]comments

   DAVIE, Fla. — The Miami Dolphins have signed free agent quarterback Dan
   Marino.

   Yes, that one.

   More than 17 years removed from his final NFL pass and 12 years after
   his enshrinement in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Marino "re-signed"
   with the Dolphins on Wednesday — as were five other prominent former
   members of the team, all inking ceremonial one-day contracts designed
   so they could officially retire as members of the franchise.

   "This organization, the team, the city, football, it all means so much
   to me," Marino said. "It's been my first love. Besides family, my first
   love is football ... and the Miami Dolphins.

   "To sign a contract for a day, I'm very proud of it. I've been very
   proud to only be a Dolphin and not play anywhere else. And the fact
   I've been a free agent for 16 years and no one's called is kind of
   upsetting to me."

   Pro Football Hall of Famers Bob Griese and Larry Little also were among
   Wednesday's signees, along with Kim Bokamper and Nat Moore. Moore is
   the Dolphins' Senior Vice President for special projects and alumni
   relations. Sam Madison was delayed and not at the event when it
   started, but was also issued a one-day deal.

   Combined, those six players spent a combined 74 seasons with the
   Dolphins. Marino retired as the NFL's all-time leader in passing yards,
   completions, attempts and touchdowns — and remains in the top five all
   time in each of those categories.

   There was some hilarity; Marino needed to put on his reading glasses
   before signing, Dolphins general manager Mike Tannenbaum made a joke
   about who has worse knees right now — Marino or injured Dolphins
   starter Ryan Tannehill — and there was some discussion regarding the
   salary structures.

   The Dolphins said they issued the contracts as part of their ongoing
   ways to honor the team's past.

   "This means a lot to us," Tannenbaum said. "Our history, our legacy,
   we're all so proud of it and all the contributions you guys have made
   to the organization means a lot to all of us."

   Marino — who works for the team as special adviser to Dolphins
   President and CEO Tom Garfinkel — announced his retirement in March
   2000, two months after his final Dolphins season ended with a playoff
   loss at Jacksonville.

   But like many players, he never actually filed retirement papers with
   the NFL.

   "I love being a Miami Dolphin," Marino said. "Even if it's for a day,
   that's fine with me."

   Griese was the starting quarterback for both of Miami's Super Bowl wins
   in the 1970s. Little played 12 seasons in Miami, including on both of
   the Super Bowl champion teams. Moore spent 13 years with the team,
   catching 74 touchdown passes. Bokamper spent nine seasons with the
   Dolphins, helping them reach two Super Bowls in the 1980s. And Madison
   intercepted 31 passes in his nine Miami seasons.

   "It was a fun time," Moore said. "And today's an opportunity to
   remember those times."
