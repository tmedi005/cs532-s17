   Sheila Marie Guzzetta [21] CARSON CITY, NV
   On Tuesday, January 24th, I took my husband Paul (35 years old) to the
   hospital. He had been dealing with a sore throat and his neck was
   swollen. He ended up being admitted to the ICU with Ludwig's Angina
   (caused by an abscessed tooth). He was in the hospital for 7 days, 4 in
   the ICU. They released him after he passed a swallow test and put him
   on antibiotics. On February 2nd, we followed up with the oral surgeon
   who told us to immediately get to the Trauma Center at the hospital.
   After dropping off our 3 kids, (10, 6 and 2), we headed to the nearest
   Trauma Center 30 miles away. There he was discovered to have an
   infection that had spread to his clavicle.
   They rushed him into surgery, that was supposed to take 30-40 minutes,
   and it ended up being 3 hours. They had to perform an emergency trach
   as his airway was blocked. He has been in the ICU since and is heavily
   sedated, on 3 different antibiotics, pain medication, and on life
   support. He has a long road to recovery ahead of him; the doctors are
   saying at least 3 weeks in the ICU alone. As he is not out of the woods
   yet, it is hour by hour and day by day waiting, worrying, and praying.
   He is our family's bread winner. Anything that is donated will go
   towards his medical care and treatment, and help to cover the cost of
   bills for our household, and travel and lodging so that our family can
   be with him in these very trying times.
   Thank you for your support. We understand not everyone can donate but
   if you can, we would be immensely grateful. And if you can't, please
   share our story as all help is welcome and needed desperately. And
   please keep us in your prayers as we believe strongly that God will
   help heal Paul and everyone's prayers will help

   Day 19 in the ICU at Renown still Critical.
   Day 29 since he was admitted into CTH.
   On Monday, February 20th they put in a Wound Vac to help suction all
   the unwanted fluid; they will change that out every other day he'll
   have that for close to a month.
   He's still running a 103.3 fever and has been for 4 days.
   As of Monday, they had him on only 1 sedation (Precedux) which he
   seemed to be doing okay on.
   When I came in this morning 2/21/2017 he was back on the Propofol
   (sedation).
   He started getting really agitated-his heart rate had increased to 170,
   his blood pressure was rising and his oxygen started dropping and he
   started sweating so they had to put him back on it. They are gonna
   increase his pain meds (Dilaudid and oxycoden) and hopefully that will
   get him comfortable enough to start getting him off the Propofol again.
   I also found out that they are changing his antibiotics again because
   they found E. coli growing. On Saturday 2/18/2017 they did blood
   cultures due to the fever and they are now starting to see what
   bacteria is growing.
   They also have him on an insulin pump because his blood sugar is over
   400.
   They are also gonna do another Bronchoscope today to look into his
   lungs because he is requiring a lot more oxygen from the ventilator
   then he has in the past.
   I really hope we can start to have some good days.
   Thank you again to everyone that has donated and shared our story.
   Please, please keep sharing.
   Thank you all!!
   Much love,
   Sheila

   As of today Saturday February 18, 2017-
   We are on day 16 of being at Renown in the ICU and day 26 from when
   this all started and he was admitted into CTH.
   The last few days have been very stressful.
   He's been off the Propofol since Valentine's Day and was put on a
   different type of sedation medicine called Ketamine which ended up
   causing really bad hallucations. It was absolutely terrifying. They
   also changed his pain meds so that he can rest more comfortable.
   They had started breathing trails on Monday, February 13th but they
   have since stopped all breathing trails due to the hallucinating and he
   required more oxygen.
   They have since taken him off the Ketamine (Thank God) and given him a
   different type of sedation called Versed. He seems to be doing really
   well on the new meds as of today.
   We are not sure when they will restart the breathing trails.
   His Hospitalist and a general surgeon both mentioned to me that they
   want to put in a Wound Vac in to help remove any unwanted fluid and
   help it heal from the inside out. Unfortunately, he still seems to be
   forming abscesses so his ENT has been coming in every other day to do
   his manipulation to break up the abscesses. They are hoping to get the
   Wound Vac in the next few days but they have to be extremely cautious
   because they need to make sure no more abscesses form.
   Due to all the swelling he's still at risk for his airway to be
   compromised so they are still keeping the Trach in.
   I talked to his Dr this morning and there are no real changes, expect
   he is running a fever of 103.7. They are running some cultures to find
   out why its spiked. They also changed both his antibiotics to help
   bring the fever down.
   They also discovered that the infection was in fact gangrene, but it's
   under control.
   They have both his sedations lowered today from what they were
   yesterday. Which is GREAT! They are just gonna keep him comfortable and
   resting. As I know more I'll let you know.
   I have to say this has been a roller coaster ride for our whole family.
   I am traveling back and forth from Carson to Reno everyday so that I'm
   there for the kids when they get out of school and staying up in Reno
   on the weekends.
   I'm really trying to hold it all together for the kids but some days
   it's so hard. This week being one of the hardest. Seeing your husband
   hallucinate and not being able to do anything for him is absolutely
   heartbreaking.
   Hearing that he was so terrified and becoming combative because he had
   no idea what was going on and that security had to be called to help
   restrain him breaks my heart even more.
   The kids seem to be taking this well. I know it's hard on them I can
   see it with just little things they say or do.
   I did bring the kids to see him last weekend for the first time and
   Anakin was here with me yesterday spending time with his dad even
   though his dad had no idea he's here.
   Luca, our youngest, doesn't get what's going on and I'm thankful for
   that. He just says daddy's got an owie and he's sleeping.
   Lillian doesn't like hearing how things are going. She gets very quite
   and kinda shuts down. So I keep it all simple with her. Daddy's doing
   good today.
   I have to say THANK YOU to the great support system I have that have
   been there for us and willing to help me out with the kids.
   I ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO EVERYONE THAT HAS DONATED! You have no
   idea how much you are helping our little family out. ❤️
   Please keep the prayers, good vibes and thoughts coming our way. We
   still have a very long road ahead of us.
   Also please please keep sharing our story.
   Much love to all of you!
   ❤️

   As of today February 12th, 2017-
   Paul's ENT Dr came in yesterday and removed some staples and the
   pin-rose drains and checked the area around the incision. He said the
   tissue looks good there's still a lot to be drained but it's healing as
   they expected.
   They are really starting to wing him off the Propofol. They've had him
   pretty low the last few days and he's had his moments of agitation but
   that's all to be expected.
   I just talked to his Hospitalist (Dr) and she said he's still critical
   and it's still a long road ahead of us because they need all the
   swelling to go down and it to keep draining.
   She doesn't see him coming off the ventilator for at least a week maybe
   more.
   Now that his sedation has been lowered he does seem to understand a
   little bit of what's going on. He asked me last night what happened and
   I was able to explain it to him and he nodded his head as if he
   understood what I was saying.
   Chances are he won't remember but that's to be expected with him being
   on the sedation meds it can cause amnesia.
   He's very scared and can't communicate with me (I'm learning to read
   his lips).
   Thank you everyone for donating and sharing our story.
   Please continue sharing and praying.
   Much love from all of us!!
   ❤️

   As of today Friday 2/10/2017- There are no new changes.
   They are keeping him heavily sedated and medicated due to the severity
   of the swelling and the Trach. There is still no timetable as to when
   they will start winging him off the ventilator and the sedation
   medication.
   We did have a small set back on Wednesday. They noticed more swelling
   and a red hot spots on his neck. They did a CT scan and found another
   abscess had formed. His ENT Dr was able to go in and do some type of
   manipulation of the abscess to break it up.
   They are still keeping a close eye on the swelling to make sure no more
   abscess form.
