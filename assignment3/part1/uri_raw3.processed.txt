   New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick has been added to a list
   of people who could be called to testify at the double murder trial of
   former player [3]Aaron Hernandez.

   Belichick's name appeared on a list of possible witnesses filed Tuesday
   by Hernandez's defense.

   Patriots offensive coordinator [4]Josh McDaniels had previously been
   named as a possible witness.

   Hernandez is charged with the drive-by slayings of Daniel de Abreu and
   Safiro Furtado in Boston in 2012. Prosecutors say Hernandez shot the
   men after one spilled a drink on him at a club.

   Hernandez has pleaded not guilty.

   Jury selection is underway, and opening statements are scheduled for
   March 1. Hernandez, who grew up in Connecticut, is serving a life
   sentence in the 2013 killing of a man who was dating the sister of
   Hernandez's fiancee.
