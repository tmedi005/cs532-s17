   WOONSOCKET — Students from the high school and the middle school were
   honored at the Hamlet Middle School building last week for their
   participation in the latest round of the CyberPatriot competition in
   Rhode Island.

   CyberPatriot competitions, run by the Air Force Association and its
   sponsors as the National Youth Cyber Education program nationwide,
   seeks to motivate students toward future careers in cyber security and
   STEM (science, technology Engineering, and Math) college courses
   through a series state and regional competitions ending with national
   finals in Baltimore in April.

   The Rhode Island competitions were sponsored by the R.I. Air National
   Guard’s 102nd Network Warfare Squadron and the R.I. State Police
   Computer Crimes Unit.

   The competition, held in Rhode Island on Jan. 13, requires
   participating student teams to look at a model network such as Cisco
   network setup and check it and the software it supports, such as
   Windows 7 or Windows 8, for any vulnerabilities or potential securities
   compromising attacks.

   Nancy Koczera, Math Department chair at Woonsocket High School, said
   the school’s team for the competition did very well this year.

   “They ended up coming in 4th place for the state in the gold round,”
   she said.

   East Greenwich took first place for the state in the statewide
   completion, Bishop Hendricken, 2nd, and Middletown, 3rd, and all three
   will advance to the next level.

   Making up Woonsocket High School’s team were Jamie Coulombe, Kevin
   Nguyen, Andrew Berard, Victoria Mayers, and Jack Gerrior, Koczera
   noted.

   Rachel Knowlton, a technology teacher at the middle school, had similar
   praise for her school’s students in the competition. The middle school
   actually put together two teams of five students each for the
   competition and did very well as CyberPatriots, she said.

   Major Charlene Marshall of the 143rd Command Flight at the Quonset Air
   Guard Base was on hand to help present the students their awards and
   praised their participation in CyberPatriot.

   “It is an excellent opportunity to expose students to the fundamentals
   of cyber security while learning about general network security
   practices, online safety, and how to secure their personal devices,
   Marshall said.

   The students also learn about ethical behavior on the Internet as well
   as understanding computer operating systems and learning to secure them
   properly, she said.

   “It gives them the opportunity to realize that this is a degree or a
   career that they can pursue in future and that it is a growing industry
   for sure,” she said.

   Meghan Martinez, a civilian employee of the State Police Computer
   Crimes Unit under Capt. John Alfred, said that the CyberPatriot program
   is intended to encourage students to pursue a formal education in cyber
   security at one of the institutions of higher education offering it in
   Rhode Island such as URI, Roger Williams University, or Salve Regina
   University.

   Cyber security is an important topic today given the potential for
   international and criminal threats to systems in the banking sector,
   health care, critical infrastructure and government, and Martinez said
   the State Police cyber security program coordinates planning and
   services with all its participating security task force partners.

   Martinez said she was impressed by the interest Rhode Island’s students
   were taking in the CyberPatriot competitions. “This was my first time
   meeting the students, their teachers and their mentors and they were
   all remarkable, really,” she said.

   Kobe Phewnvandeng, a member of the Hamlet team, said he plans to
   participate in the CyberPatriot program again next year but doesn’t yet
   know if he will pursue it as a career. “I might, I like playing the
   cyber security games, but I also have a goal of going to school for
   video game design,” he said. “I think that is going to be fun, too,” he
   said.

   As for the competition itself, Phewnvandeng said he did learn a lot
   about all the different types of computer viruses computer users must
   be aware of and also how to eliminate them.

   Jamie Coulombe, a senior at the high school, said she also learned
   about the basic protocols of cyber security and what steps must be
   taken to prevent computer intrusions on both computer networks and
   computer platforms and also how to fix them when a break into a system
   occurs.

   “Basically you look at the computer coding to finding the locations
   where problems exist and then fix them,” she said. The work she has
   done so far has been very interesting, Coulombe said. “I think I would
   like to major in computer science,” she said.
