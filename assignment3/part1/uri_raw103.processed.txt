Super Bowl LI Film Review: The Patriots’ two-point conversions

   [48]New, [49]6 comments

To come back from a 16-point fourth quarter deficit, the Patriots needed two
touchdowns and two two-point conversions.

   The New England Patriots entered the fourth quarter of Super Bowl LI
   down 28-9 against the Atlanta Falcons. A 33-yard Stephen Gostkowski
   field goal brought the Patriots within 16, making it a two-possession
   game. Of course, those two possessions needed to be capped by two
   touchdowns and two successful two-point conversions in order to erase
   the deficit.

   Only three plays after the field goal, linebacker Dont’a Hightower
   forced a Matt Ryan-fumble, which was recovered by defensive tackle Alan
   Branch. Starting on Atlanta’s 25-yard line, New England needed five
   plays – the last of which a 6-yard touchdown pass from Tom Brady to
   Danny Amendola – to come one successful two-point attempt of making it
   a one-possession game.

   And the Patriots did just that.

1) (Direct Snap) TWO-POINT CONVERSION ATTEMPT. J.White rushes up the middle.
ATTEMPT SUCCEEDS.

   New England’s offense used an 11-personnel group on its first two-point
   try of the game. Julian Edelman (#11) and Malcolm Mitchell (#19)
   aligned in a slot formation on the weak side of the formation. Tight
   end Martellus Bennett (#88) lined up in a two-point stance on the right
   tackle’s outside shoulder, with Chris Hogan (#15) covering him up.

   Running back James White (#28) was originally flanked out wide to the
   right but motioned to the backfield prior to the snap to align to Tom
   Brady’s (#12) left:
   (c) NFL Game Pass

   Atlanta used a nickel defense with four down-linemen and two
   off-the-line backers to defend the Patriots’ personnel group. Due to
   White’s motion towards the center of the formation, Atlanta changed its
   secondary alignment. Strong safety Keanu Neal (#22) moved to the box to
   line up over the right-side B-gap, while deep safety Ricardo Allen
   (#37) moved closer towards the boundary.

   Despite Atlanta employing a relatively light front, this motion gave
   the defense a numbers advantage over the Patriots blockers. New England
   countered the defensive alignment by going right at its heart: the
   defensive tackles. The Patriots did this with two double-team blocks
   paving the way for the designed inside run.
   (c) NFL Game Pass

   After David Andrews (#60) snapped the football to White – not perfectly
   but well enough for the running back to grab it – the center
   immediately moved to his left to team up with guard Joe Thuney (#62) in
   blocking defensive tackle Ra’Shede Hageman (#77). After initial
   contact, Andrews peeled off to move to the second level and take on
   linebacker Deion Jones (#45).

   In the meantime, the right side of the Patriots’ offensive line – guard
   Shaq Mason (#69) and tackle Marcus Cannon (#61) – took on Jonathan
   Babineaux (#95). The double team created excellent upfield push, which
   a) clogged a potential attack lane for Neal while b) allowing Mason to
   disengage as well and serve as a lead blocker through the A-gap.
   (c) NFL Game Pass

   White followed Mason’s lead to take the football into the endzone and
   make the Super Bowl a one-possession game:

   Overall, the Patriots’ offense executed the play call brilliantly. The
   offensive line was able to get the necessary push to create a running
   lane for White and the outside players – Bennett and left tackle Nate
   Solder (#77) – won their one-on-one blocking assignments. Furthermore,
   Brady sold the fake well which in turn froze Neal and Jones just long
   enough.

2) TWO-POINT CONVERSION ATTEMPT. T.Brady pass to D.Amendola is complete.
ATTEMPT SUCCEEDS.

   On their next possession, the Patriots scored their second fourth
   quarter touchdown to come within one successful two-point attempt of
   tying the game. After James White’s 1-yard scoring run to make it a
   28-26 game in Atlanta’s favor, New England used a 10-personnel group
   aligned in an empty 3x2 formation.

   Three wide receivers – Danny Amendola (#80), Chris Hogan (#15), Julian
   Edelman (#11) – lined up on the offense’s left. Malcolm Mitchell (#19),
   the fourth wideout, joined running back James White (#28) in a
   two-player stack on the right side:
   (c) NFL Game Pass

   On the other side of the line of scrimmage, Atlanta used a dime package
   consisting of four cornerbacks and two safeties player a cover 0
   man-to-man defense. With the Falcons covering New England’s receivers
   one-on-one, offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels called a perfect play
   to take advantage of the defense’s alignment: a screen pass.

   Just prior to the snap, Amendola, the receiver playing closest to the
   left-side boundary, started to move inwards. Being in man-coverage,
   cornerback Brian Poole (#34) mirrored the motion. At that point, Tom
   Brady (#12) received the snap and made a quick one-step drop before
   releasing the football towards Amendola. Simultaneously, Hogan and
   Edelman were starting to set up their blocks:
   (c) NFL Game Pass

   In order to follow Amendola, Poole needed to move around behind
   defensive backs Jalen Collins (#32) and Robert Alford (#23). And this
   is exactly what New England exploited with the play call as Brady
   delivered the football just when Amendola and Poole were moving across
   the field. With Hogan and Edelman blocking Collins and Alford,
   respectively, Poole’s lane at the pass catcher was closed and the
   defender remained stuck in traffic:
   (c) NFL Game Pass

   The key to the play were Hogan and Edelman being able to block their
   assigned defensive backs. And while Hogan could have been flagged for
   blocking past one yard of the line of scrimmage, a penalty – which
   would have been an offset to Atlanta’s offside call on the same play –
   would have been a surprise given the way the game was called up to that
   point.

   Edelman did a great job of driving Alford back, which in turn also
   blocked the path of safety Ricardo Allen (#37), who reacted immediately
   to the play. While Hogan was unable to sustain his block throughout the
   entire process, he still did a good job of stopping both Collins and
   Poole from tackling Amendola before he reached the endzone. In short:
   The Patriots were able to stop four defenders with two blockers.

   As has been the case on the first two-point attempt, New England’s
   offense executed close to perfection. Quarterback, offensive line,
   receivers and blockers all did their job which allowed the Patriots to
   tie Super Bowl LI at 28 with not even one minute left in the fourth
   quarter.

   The Patriots [56]entered the Super Bowl with three two-point plays at
   their disposal. They used all three, and all three were well executed
   and allowed the team to come back from a 25-point deficit and
   ultimately win their fifth Lombardi Trophy.
