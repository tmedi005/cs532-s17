Jimmy Garoppolo and the Dak Prescott Phenomenon</strong></p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="135">Remember one thing about the combine and <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/nfl">NFL</a> draft: Around this time, almost everyone in football lies.</p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="136">All the time. Every second. Lie upon lie upon lie. Teams do it as a sort of misinformation campaign, hoping some sucker club falls for a lie. So as you read information about the combine and draft, remember this fact.</p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="137">Yet there are some truth-tellers who never lie (at least I don't think they do). What those executives are telling me—three of them, two from the NFC—is they believe some team is going to make the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/new-england-patriots">New England Patriots</a> an offer for Jimmy Garoppolo they cannot refuse. </p><div class="ad" data-reactid="138"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert" data-reactid="139"><div id="br-ad-92215508" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="1" data-position="rect_atf_01" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[1270,0],[[970,250],[970,66],[300,250],[320,1]]],[[728,0],[[728,90],[300,250],[320,1]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[320,50],[320,1]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]" data-reactid="140"></div></div></div><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="141">I want to be clear about what I'm being told: They believe several teams are preparing to make blockbuster offers for Garoppolo. I'm not saying it will happen. I'm saying this is the belief of some around football. They think a draft shakeup is coming and that it will involve Garoppolo.</p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="142">The increasingly popular view among some in the league is that Garoppolo can transform a franchise almost overnight and is worth a first-round pick.</p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="143">There's a desperation that's sweeping the league when it comes to finding a quarterback, greater than I've seen in a long time. One front-office executive called it the Dak Prescott Phenomenon.</p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="144">Prescott was a big reason the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/dallas-cowboys">Cowboys</a> transformed their franchise, and some people in football think Garoppolo can do the same. This is a massive assumption, but, again, teams may think it's worth the risk and the high price it would take.</p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="145">There's evidence Garoppolo could be effective. He completed 71.2 percent of his passes in two games against Arizona and <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/miami-dolphins">Miami</a>. He threw for 496 yards and four scores combined.</p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="146">The Patriots have become the best franchise in football, and one reason is the way they have accumulated draft picks and then drafted smartly. They have been far from perfect, but pretty good. Trading Garoppolo would fit into what the Patriots have done under <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/bill-belichick">Bill Belichick</a>.</p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="147">Yes, everyone lies.</p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="148">But I do think the Garoppolo talk is heating up, and I'm not sure it's going away soon.</p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="149"> </p><p class="htmlElement" data-reactid="150"><strong>2.
