   Zero-point-two percent. Two in a thousand. The [104]New England
   Patriots stunned the St. Louis Rams to win the first Super Bowl of the
   Bill Belichick-[105]Tom Brady era during the 2001 playoffs, but even
   that upset can't compare to the comeback New England pulled to beat the
   [106]Atlanta Falcons 34-28 on Sunday night in Super Bowl LI. The Pats
   pieced together incredible play with fortuitous bounces and impeccable
   timing to overcome a Falcons team that had a 99.8 percent shot of
   claiming its first Super Bowl with 21 minutes to go.

   What happened from then on was nothing short of a miracle. The Patriots
   needed just about everything to go right and had the vast majority of
   those moments swing their way. It all blurs together in the aftermath,
   but let's run through those big plays to piece together how the
   Patriots got one for the thumb.
     __________________________________________________________________

Third quarter, 6:04 left -- Falcons 28, Patriots 3

   Fourth-and-3, Patriots' 46: Brady completes pass to [107]Danny Amendola
   for 17 yards.
   Win expectancy shift: 0.2 percent to 0.5 percent (+0.3 percent)

   The first tiny shift in New England's favor came after the Patriots
   unsuccessfully pulled out a desperation trick pass from [108]Julian
   Edelman to [109]Dion Lewis on third down. Turning the ball over on
   downs probably would have ended the game, given that the Falcons would
   have taken over on the New England 46-yard line having scored
   touchdowns on three of their previous four possessions. Instead, Brady
   hit Amendola on an out route against Falcons cornerback [110]Brian
   Poole to extend the Patriots' drive. Their win expectancy would come
   close to 0.3 percent later on, but never quite dip below what it was
   prior to that completion.

       Josh McDaniels said: "All I could do was hold my breath, thinking

   The Patriots' drive continued with Brady scrambling for 15 yards when
   the Falcons lost containment on a third-and-8, finishing with Brady
   finding [117]James White out of the backfield on a snag concept for a
   5-yard touchdown to make the score 28-9.

   Two things then went against the Patriots in successive fashion.
   [118]Stephen Gostkowski promptly booted the ensuing extra point attempt
   against the upright, leaving the score at 28-9. Given that the Patriots
   had [119]incorrectly been called for an illegal formation penalty
   earlier in the game that gave the Falcons a second chance at an extra
   point, New England had lost two points on conversions. It seemed mostly
   irrelevant at the time, but it would loom as incredibly important later
   on.

   Gostkowski followed that by taking an illegal touching penalty on an
   attempted onside kick, one which the Falcons recovered anyway. Atlanta
   then had a second-and-1 on the New England 32-yard line.

Third quarter, 0:59 left -- Falcons 28, Patriots 9

   Second-and-1, Patriots' 32: [120]Jake Matthews commits holding penalty
   (10 yards).
   Win expectancy shift: 0.3 percent to 0.5 percent (+0.2 percent)

   In a sequence that would repeat itself in slightly different order
   later in the game, a Matthews holding penalty pushed the Falcons out of
   field goal range. Atlanta could have gone up 22 points with a
   successful field goal (and would have had a third-and-2 if Matthews
   hadn't held on this stuffed [121]Tevin Coleman run), but [122]Matt Ryan
   was sacked on the ensuing third down to force an Atlanta punt from
   midfield. They got nothing from the excellent field position afforded
   them by recovering the onside kick try.

   Brady went to work as the game went into the fourth quarter, with the
   Patriots eventually moving the ball into the red zone. He was sacked
   twice on three plays by [123]Grady Jarrett, though, leading to a play
   that sets the scene for the rest of the game.

Fourth quarter, 9:48 left -- Falcons 28, Patriots 9

   Fourth-and-goal, Falcons' 15: Gostkowski kicks 33-yard field goal.
   Win expectancy shift: 0.3 percent to 0.4 percent (+0.1 percent)

   Settling for three points to make the game 28-12 basically did nothing
   for New England's win expectancy. The field goal to bring the Patriots
   within 16 points worked out perfectly in the end, but it set a
   nearly-impossible target for the Patriots to hit. As tempting as it is
   to say that the Patriots are making it a two-touchdown game by kicking
   the field goal, it's really not accurate to lump a 16-point deficit in
   with, say, a 14-point margin. So much more has to go right for you to
   win the game. To successfully chase a 16-point target, all of the
   following has to happen:
     * You have to stop the other team from scoring a single point the
       rest of the way.
     * You have to lead two touchdown drives.
     * You have to convert on a pair of two-point conversions.
     * You have to win in overtime.

   If we assume for simplicity's sake that the chance of converting each
   of the two-pointers is 50 percent, and the chance of the Patriots
   winning in overtime is 50 percent, the chances of the Patriots making
   the two-pointers and then winning in overtime alone reduce their shot
   to 12.5 percent. That's without even considering how hard it's going to
   be to score both of those touchdowns while stopping the Falcons from
   scoring once.

   By definition, that 50 percent two-point rate suggests a 16-point game
   isn't a two-score contest. We know that each attempt is independent,
   and given the 50 percent conversion rate, we would expect them to
   convert one out of two tries and produce a total of two points. The
   Patriots pulled it out here, but the 2015 Patriots and 2016 Chiefs can
   remind you of how leaving the game to a late two-point try is far from
   guaranteed.

   An older version of the win expectancy model developed by ESPN's Brian
   Burke suggests the Patriots' chances of winning with a touchdown on
   fourth-and-15 would have leaped to 3.6 percent, producing that 9
   percent break-even rate. It's not a perfect parallel, since teams would
   likely be willing to settle for field goals, but since 2006, teams have
   converted third-and-goal from the 15-yard line five times in 45 tries.
   That's a 10.6 percent rate, and it's reasonable to think the Patriots
   are better than your standard offense. I suspect the numbers leaned
   narrowly toward going for it, although it would have been a much
   stronger case had the Patriots managed to pick up a few yards on third
   down in lieu of taking a sack.

   Having fumbled the ball away during the first half before gifting
   [124]Robert Alford a pick-six, the Patriots needed to catch a break.
   They finally got one on the next drive.

Fourth quarter, 8:31 left -- Falcons 28, Patriots 12

   Third-and-1, Falcons' 36: [125]Dont'a Hightower strip-sacks Ryan;
   [126]Alan Branch recovers.
   Win expectancy shift: 0.3 percent to 1.8 percent (+1.5 percent)

   Instead of moving the chains on third-and-1 and taking two more minutes
   off the clock with a fresh set of downs, the Falcons handed the ball
   back to New England with a short field. [127]Hightower came on a blitz
   and sped past the middling block attempt of [128]Devonta Freeman, who
   was inserted into the game after Coleman went down with an injury on
   the previous play. Freeman looked confused before the snap and seemed
   to be caught between attempting to block Hightower and releasing into
   the flat as an outlet receiver, and he ended up doing neither.

   Hightower converged on Ryan along with [129]Chris Long, who had gotten
   underneath Matthews, to force a fumble as Ryan attempted to release a
   pass. The Patriots fell on the fumble, which was notable because it was
   the first fumble of the postseason in a Falcons game that Atlanta had
   failed to recover, having picked up the previous six.

   Brady was sacked on the first play of the next series by [130]Dwight
   Freeney, but the Falcons' pass rush got to him just one more time the
   rest of the way. From that point forward, Brady went 15-of-19 for 170
   yards with two touchdowns, the game-tying two-point conversion to
   Amendola, and the 13-yard pass interference call that set up the
   game-winning touchdown in overtime.

Fourth quarter, 6:00 left -- Falcons 28, Patriots 12

   Second-and-2, Falcons' 6: Brady hits Amendola for 6-yard touchdown;
   White converts two-pointer.
   Win expectancy shift: 2.2 percent to 6.1 percent (+3.9 percent)

   There's still a lot of work to be done, but at 28-20, the Patriots are
   suddenly in business. Brady found a mismatch with Amendola aligned in
   the slot against the bigger [131]Jalen Collins and took advantage,
   [132]getting Amendola on a quick out (with [133]Malcolm Mitchell
   arguably interfering with the outside corner) for the 6-yard score. As
   [134]Matt Bowen diagrammed, the Patriots then ran a direct snap to
   White with a pair of double-teams to set up the first of their
   two-point conversions.

   Again, though: The Patriots still need a stop, a scoring drive, a
   two-point conversion, and a win in overtime. They almost failed on the
   first of those prerequisites when the Patriots blew the coverage on
   Freeman [135]on a 39-yard checkdown and were then victimized by an
   absurd [136]Julio Jones catch for 27 yards.

   After Freeman was stuffed on a first-and-10 pitch for a loss of one,
   the Falcons ran the clock down and had second-and-11 on the New England
   23-yard line with 3:56 to go. If the Falcons had simply kneeled twice,
   they could have kicked what would have been about a 43-yard field goal
   while presumably costing the Patriots two of their three remaining
   timeouts. A 43-yard field goal -- which all but ends the game -- is
   hardly guaranteed, but [137]Matt Bryant is 29-of-31 (93.5 percent) on
   kicks between 40 and 45 yards over the past five seasons.

Fourth quarter, 3:56 left -- Falcons 28, Patriots 20

   Second-and-11, Patriots' 23: Ryan sacked by [138]Trey Flowers for
   12-yard loss.
   Third-and-23, Patriots' 33: Matthews commits holding penalty (10
   yards).
   Third-and-33, Patriots' 43: Ryan throws incomplete pass.
   Win expectancy shift: 1.4 percent to 4.9 percent (+3.5 percent)

   Instead, inexplicably, the Falcons chose to pass the ball on second
   down, on a slow-developing play that ended with Ryan going down for a
   coverage sack at the hands of Flowers, who slipped between center
   [139]Alex Mack and right guard [140]Chris Chester. The sack is partly
   on Ryan, who needed to get the ball out and held onto it for more than
   four seconds before hitting the turf.

   Ryan is at fault, but so is Atlanta's highly regarded offensive
   coordinator, Kyle Shanahan. I'm as aggressive as anybody when it comes
   to suggesting that coaches try to get their kickers in better field
   goal range in lieu of settling for 50-plus-yard field goal tries, but
   if there was ever a situation that called for conservatism given the
   game situation, it was this one. Shanahan admitted after the game that
   he couldn't remember the playcalling decisions he made at this point of
   the game, conflating the ensuing plays with the sack, which is fair. It
   seems the entire Falcons team blacked out right around this point of
   the game.

   range. Richard Mackson/USA TODAY Sports

   The situation was still salvageable given that the Falcons were in line
   for a 51-yard field goal and had a play to try to pick up extra yardage
   while burning more time, but Matthews made a bad situation worse by
   committing yet another crucial holding penalty, wrapping his arms
   around Long's neck to push the Falcons out of field goal range. The
   Pats held up in coverage on third down and forced a punt. New England
   had two plays to either force a turnover or push the Falcons back 20
   yards to get out of field goal range and managed to do the latter.

   After Brady beat a Falcons blitz on third-and-10 for a 16-yard
   completion to Hogan, the drive was off and running. You'll probably be
   seeing its most notable play for a while ...

Fourth quarter, 2:28 left -- Falcons 28, Patriots 20

   First-and-10, Patriots' 36: Brady completes 23-yard pass to Edelman.
   Win expectancy shift: 6.1 percent to 8.7 percent (+2.6 percent)

   Of course, no win expectancy model is going to know what Edelman had to
   do to [141]bring in the greatest catch he'll ever make. Brady made the
   curious decision to throw into double coverage, with Alford trailing
   Edelman and [142]Keanu Neal playing over the top on that side. His
   throw wasn't perfect, giving Alford a chance to pick the ball off.
   Instead, Alford tipped the ball into the air and somehow gave Edelman a
   chance to bring it in on a double-clutch. I've watched the play 20
   times and I'm still convinced Edelman's going to drop the ball each
   time I watch it.

   I'm of two minds regarding Dan Quinn's challenge after the catch.
   Ideally, Quinn would have let the clock run to the two-minute warning
   and spent the break watching replays before deciding to use his final
   timeout on a challenge. The television feed of the game doesn't make it
   clear whether the Patriots would have been able to run a play before
   the two-minute warning, although it was very clear that the Patriots
   were sprinting to the line in the hopes of running a play before Quinn
   could get a good look. (The coaches tape of the game will not be
   available until midweek.)

   The play was obviously close, and it was literally Quinn's last chance
   to use a challenge. Twenty-three yards isn't an enormous swing of field
   position, but the Pats would have been in second-and-10. Quinn's
   challenge stopped the clock before the two-minute warning, and the Pats
   used the extra play to complete a deep crossing route to Amendola for
   20 more yards versus Poole. That would push the Patriots up into double
   digits at 13.2 percent. Three plays later, on the Atlanta 1-yard line,
   the Pats punched the ball in.

   don't know what the dang rule is about a catch. But I was pretty sure I
   caught it." Ezra Shaw, Getty Images

Fourth quarter, 1:00 left -- Falcons 28, Patriots 20

   Second-and-goal, Falcons' 1: White rushes for 1-yard touchdown;
   Amendola converts two-pointer.
   Win expectancy shift: 21.2 percent to 53.0 percent (+31.8 percent)

   There's the big leap. The Patriots, who were 55.7 percent favorites to
   win as of the opening kickoff, are favored again to prevail for the
   first time since [143]LeGarrette Blount's fumble on the second play of
   the second quarter. If it felt like the Patriots were destined to win
   in overtime, I won't blame you, but I'll also remind you of [144]last
   year's Packers-Cardinals playoff game, when [145]Aaron Rodgers
   converted two Hail Mary passes to tie the game up just before overtime
   and never touched the ball again. You may also remember Super Bowl
   XXXVI, when the Rams tied the score with 1:13 left and the Patriots
   drove 53 yards with no timeouts ([146]against the advice of John
   Madden) to set up [147]Adam Vinatieri's game-winning field goal.

   Atlanta still might have been able to muster a drive to at least
   attempt a game-winning field goal. The Patriots helped out by making a
   strategic mistake and snapping the ball with 21 seconds to go on the
   game clock during the White touchdown. It's not necessarily a good idea
   to run the play clock down to one second left before snapping the ball,
   but Brady should have shaved another 10-12 seconds off the clock before
   the snap. The argument that the Patriots needed to conserve time in
   case of a failed two-point conversion doesn't really hold water; if the
   Patriots failed, they were going to be stuck attempting an expected
   onside kick to try to get one final possession. The chances of
   recovering that onside kick are likely lower than the chances of giving
   up a meaningful drive to the Falcons with a minute left on the clock.

   Instead, fortunately for the Patriots, Atlanta's drive started on the
   11-yard line and sputtered out after 16 yards. New England then hoped
   to set up for a game-winning [148]fair catch free kick, but [149]Matt
   Bosher's punt was too far to feasibly attempt one. The Pats then sent
   Lewis out to run a meaningless draw with three seconds left, with Lewis
   suffering a game-ending hamstring injury on the play.

Overtime, 12:37 left -- Falcons 28, Patriots 28

   Second-and-13, Falcons' 40: Brady hits Edelman for 15 yards.
   Win expectancy shift: 58.5 percent to 75.5 percent (+17.0 percent)

   The biggest play of New England's lone drive in overtime turned a
   difficult second-and-13 into a first down, putting the Patriots in
   field goal range and on the edge of the red zone. The Patriots went
   five-wide, and the Falcons responded by showing pre-snap pressure
   before dropping into a Cover 1 Robber look, with one deep safety and
   the impressive [150]Deion Jones lurking in the middle of the field to
   take away drag routes. The Patriots went back to an impeccably timed
   combination of crossing routes, which the Falcons had been able to
   knock away during the fourth quarter. This time, though, the timing was
   excellent to create a subtle rub downfield, and Brady's throw was right
   on the money. Four plays later, the Patriots were champions.
     __________________________________________________________________

But how?

   Those are the plays that led the Patriots to their stunning Super Bowl
   victory, but what was changing in the broader matchup of the game that
   allowed the Patriots to come back? How could the Falcons allow Brady &
   Co. to score the final 31 points of the game after going up 28-3
   halfway through the third quarter? Let's run through the ways the
   Patriots improved and the Falcons declined as the game went along,
   starting with one critical component ...

   The Atlanta pass rush disappeared. I wrote in my [151]Super Bowl
   preview that the game would turn on whether the Falcons would be able
   to get pass pressure on Brady. I was right about that, but I was wrong
   about whether the Falcons would be able to pester the future Hall of
   Famer. Quinn's defense spent most of the day in Brady's face, and it
   did so without blitzing. Atlanta sent an extra man on just 7.4 percent
   of Brady's dropbacks but was able to get plenty of pressure with its
   front four. Through the first three quarters, Atlanta pressured Brady
   on 44.7 percent of his dropbacks.

   As was the case in both of New England's Super Bowl losses to the
   Giants, much of that pressure came up the middle. Defensive tackle
   Grady Jarrett, who had all of three sacks during the regular season,
   came up with three sacks of Brady in the Super Bowl alone, tying the
   championship game record. Jarrett and his teammates abused Patriots
   right guard [152]Shaq Mason, who had a dismal night in pass protection.
   NFL sack leader [153]Vic Beasley had a mostly quiet night, finishing
   with a lone knockdown of Brady and a pass breakup on a fade to
   [154]Martellus Bennett on the penultimate play of the game, which was
   apparently Josh McDaniels' ode to Darrell Bevell.

   Falcons' defense in the process. Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images

   As the game went along, though, the plays simply began to add up.
   Atlanta's defense faced nearly twice as many snaps as New England's;
   the 93-47 disparity between the two was the largest gap in NFL playoff
   history, per the Elias Sports Bureau. Those 93 offensive plays
   represent the second most a team has faced in playoff history (behind
   only the Jets, who faced 96 against the Browns [155]in a game that went
   into double-overtime in January 1987).

   By the time the fourth quarter rolled around, Atlanta's pass rush was
   gassed. During the fourth quarter and overtime, its pressure rate on
   Brady fell from 44.7 percent down to 20.0 percent, including an O-fer
   on Brady's six pass attempts during the extra period. Unsurprisingly,
   once the pass pressure went away, Brady picked the Falcons apart. He
   finished the day with a 64.1 passer rating under duress and a 107.0
   mark when avoiding pressure.

   The Patriots successfully attacked the weaker links in the Atlanta
   secondary. Again, this shouldn't have been news given the expectations
   coming into the game, but the Falcons were able to hold up with
   relatively anonymous defensive backs making plays during the first
   half. [156]Deji Olatoye and [157]C.J. Goodwin played a combined 18
   defensive snaps during the first two rounds of the playoffs, but with
   the Falcons playing more two-deep coverage at first glance and the
   Patriots using more three- and four-wideout sets, the Falcons rotated
   their backup defensive backs into the game for a combined 47 snaps.
   Goodwin, in particular, made his mark in the first half by knocking
   away a fade route to Mitchell out of the slot and tackling White in the
   open field on third down to end a drive.

   As the game wore on, though, the Patriots began to take advantage of
   mismatches in the secondary. They matched up Mitchell against Goodwin
   for critical conversions during the comeback, including a third-and-11
   pickup in the fourth quarter to extend the drive. Combinations of curl
   routes are a great way to beat Cover 3, and Mitchell went after both
   Goodwin and the larger Collins, who had trouble in space against New
   England's speedier wideouts. Poole also had trouble with Amendola, who
   had eight catches for 78 yards and a touchdown in what might have been
   his final game as a member of the organization.

   They also found mismatches for White, who caught a Super Bowl-record 14
   passes in much the same way that [158]Shane Vereen took over at times
   against Quinn's Seattle defense during Super Bowl XLIX. White became a
   coverage problem for Deion Jones and [159]De'Vondre Campbell, much as
   he was frustrating against [160]Bobby Wagner and [161]K.J. Wright
   versus the Seahawks.

   They took Blount out of the game for White. Blount seemed like a
   logical fit to play a big role in this contest, given how the Falcons
   had the league's fourth-worst run defense during the regular season and
   are built around speed as opposed to strength, but it didn't work out.
   Blount dragged down the Patriots' offense in the first half, carrying
   the ball eight times for just 16 yards, including a third-and-1 stuff
   and a lost fumble.

   The Pats trotted him out for three consecutive runs late in the third
   quarter, but otherwise, he was basically left on the bench as New
   England launched its comeback. He finished the game taking just 17
   offensive snaps, while White finished with 71 snaps. To put that in
   context, no Patriots running back had suited up for more than 48
   offensive plays in a game this year. ESPN has player participation data
   going back through 2007, and the only Belichick running back to top
   White's 71 snaps over that time frame was Danny Woodhead, who took 73
   snaps during a 41-35 thriller against the 49ers in 2012.

   Brady's receivers stopped dropping passes. I don't think Brady would
   characterize this as his sharpest game, as he missed a number of
   receivers downfield, notably a streaking Edelman on a wheel route. He
   also didn't get a ton of help early on. Brady's receivers dropped three
   of his 35 passes through the first three quarters (an 8.6 percent
   clip), and there were a number of 50-50 passes his wideouts failed to
   bring in. (Ryan's receivers, in comparison, didn't drop any of his 23
   pass attempts.) The Patriots' wideouts repeatedly struggled on a route
   they clearly wanted to target in man coverage, the wheel/fade out of
   the slot.

   Bennett caught a 25-yard pass over Neal on that very route in the
   fourth quarter, though, and the Pats went back to it with Bennett in
   overtime for the pass interference penalty that set up the game-winning
   score. Brady's receivers stepped up their concentration and made every
   catch count; they didn't drop a single one of Brady's 27 pass attempts
   during the fourth quarter and overtime.

   The Patriots sent extra men at Ryan. The 2016 MVP dropped back 10 times
   during the first half, and while he was sacked twice, the other eight
   plays produced seven receptions for 115 yards, a touchdown and a
   perfect passer rating of 158.3. The Patriots blitzed just once on those
   10 dropbacks for a 10 percent blitz rate. During the second half, the
   Pats brought in [162]Elandon Roberts for [163]Shea McClellin in their
   nickel package and blitzed far more frequently. This was also just a
   17-dropback sample, but the Patriots blitzed Ryan 41.2 percent of the
   time and sacked him on three of those opportunities. Ryan still posted
   a 126.8 passer rating, but because QBR accounts for sacks, his QBR fell
   from 91.5 in the first half to 62.0 afterward.

   Ryan's tackles were not a source of strength, particularly Matthews,
   who was a liability in pass protection far too frequently Sunday and
   committed those two critical holding penalties. Right tackle [164]Ryan
   Schraeder was fine before leaving with an injury, but then the Falcons
   bought in [165]Tom Compton, whom the Patriots immediately targeted with
   a defensive line game on that ridiculous 27-yard catch by Julio Jones.
   Behind the league's healthiest offensive line, Compton had been needed
   for only 69 offensive snaps during the regular season. The pressure
   prevented the Falcons from throwing more passes to Jones, who finished
   with four catches on a mere four targets for 87 yards.

   The Atlanta running game sputtered. The biggest surprise of the game
   for me early on was that the Falcons had tons of success moving the
   ball on the ground against the league's [166]fourth-ranked rushing
   defense per DVOA. Shanahan dialed up [167]the crack toss play against
   New England in man coverage early on in the contest and had plenty of
   success, including a 37-yard run by Freeman. He and Coleman combined
   for 86 yards on nine carries during the first 30 minutes.

   Afterward, though, the Patriots adjusted. They again faced nine rushing
   attempts during the second half, but this time, those runs generated a
   total of only 18 yards. Five of them went for no gain or a loss.

   The Falcons didn't manage the clock well. While the Falcons couldn't
   have known that New England would make its miraculous comeback, they
   helped the Patriots by leaving time on the clock in the fourth quarter
   and snapping early in the play clock. After the 39-yard checkdown to a
   wide-open Freeman gave Atlanta first-and-10 at their own 49-yard line
   with 5:39 to go, Ryan snapped the ball with 20 seconds left on the play
   clock and handed the ball off for a loss of 1. The next play, the
   27-yard deep out to Jones, was snapped with 13 seconds left on the
   clock. The Falcons did wind the play clock down inside five seconds on
   their next opportunity after a Freeman stuff, but that was their last
   chance to run clock on offense all game.

   Quinn also didn't get much value for his timeouts. Atlanta had to use
   one timeout early in the third quarter when they were struggling to
   line up on defense before a third-and-long. A second timeout came after
   the first Matthews holding penalty toward the end of the third quarter
   on second-and-11, while the final timeout flew off the shelves when
   Quinn challenged the ridiculous Edelman catch. If Ryan hits that final
   drive with a minute and two timeouts, the playcalling would have been
   fundamentally different.

   quarter. Gregory Shamus/Getty Images

   Gostkowski was a monster on kickoffs. While Gostkowski missed yet
   another extra point in what has been an uneven season for New England's
   star kicker on scoring plays, he has retained much of his effectiveness
   on kickoffs and created valuable field position for the Patriots'
   defense in Sunday's second half. Gostkowski didn't kick off until the
   final play of the first half, and that was a squib kick. He
   subsequently attempted both an onside kick and a deliberately short
   pop-up kick on two of his five kickoff attempts during the second half.

   His other three kickoffs, though, each pinned the Falcons inside of
   their own 20-yard line. One was returned to the Falcons' 19-yard line,
   but the two truly great kicks came on Gostkowski's final two kickoffs
   of the game. The first, with the Patriots down 28-20, was booted to the
   3-yard line with enough hang time for the coverage units to pin down
   Justin Hardy and limit him to a 7-yard return, starting Atlanta on the
   10-yard line. Given that the Falcons finished the drive a few desperate
   yards away from what would have been game-sealing field goal range,
   Gostkowski's kickoff might have helped save the season. After the
   Patriots tied the score, Gostkowski delivered a similarly effective
   kickoff to the goal line, which [168]Eric Weems returned to his own
   11-yard line to start a disappointingly short possession.

   The Atlanta offense couldn't stay on the field. More than anything,
   though, the Falcons blew their lead because they couldn't come through
   with conversions on third down. They had picked up 64.0 percent of
   their third downs in the playoffs heading into the Super Bowl, but went
   just 1-for-8 on Sunday, with a second conversion coming on a ninth
   third down via penalty.

   Every third-down failure is bad for an offense, but these breakdowns
   were both wildly frustrating and eventually very meaningful. Ryan was
   sacked four times on third down, including on third-and-3 and
   third-and-5 to end Atlanta's first two possessions. The Hightower
   strip-sack came on a third-and-1. He also took a sack on third-and-11
   from the Patriots' 42-yard line on a play where a completion, even if
   it were short of the sticks, might have created an opportunity for a
   long field goal. Nobody expected Ryan to convert third-and-33 from the
   Patriots' 45-yard line in the fourth quarter, but he failed to complete
   a pass that might have set up Bryant for a field goal or even forced
   the Patriots into using one of their two remaining timeouts.

   Atlanta's two third-down conversions resulted in touchdowns. One was a
   touchdown itself, when the Falcons isolated tight end [169]Austin
   Hooper against [170]Patrick Chung on consecutive plays. The other was a
   pass interference call in the red zone on [171]Malcolm Butler that set
   up a touchdown for Coleman on a pick play the following snap.

   It's still hard to believe the Falcons actually lost this game. They're
   the first team in Super Bowl history to lose with a pick-six in its
   pocket, one that felt like an unlikely gift given that it came from
   Brady. Some will throw around the "choker" label, which is inelegant at
   best and condescendingly incurious at worst. If choking means running
   after a quarterback on 68 dropbacks until there's hardly any air left
   in your lungs, the Falcons choked.

   Instead, it's fairer to say the Falcons never shut the door. They had
   several chances to finish this game off and never really took advantage
   of any of them, leaving a tiny opening that most teams wouldn't have
   been able to exploit. Even the Patriots, as good as they are, needed
   fortuitous timing with penalties and turnovers plus one of the all-time
   legendary catches in football history from Edelman to stay within
   range.

   Atlanta should be proud of what it has accomplished this season and
   what it did in the Super Bowl. It's what the Falcons didn't do that
   will be keeping everyone in the organization up late at night for weeks
   to come. They gave Tom Brady and Bill Belichick a chance to kick their
   door down, and yet again, the two future Hall of Famers produced a late
   drive to come away with a Super Bowl victory.
