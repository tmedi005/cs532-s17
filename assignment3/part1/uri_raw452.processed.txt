   BOSTON -- [30]New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick could be
   called as a witness in the double murder trial of [31]Aaron Hernandez,
   according to court documents released Wednesday,[32] CBS Boston
   reports.

   Belichick’s name appeared on a list of possible witnesses filed Tuesday
   by Hernandez’s defense.

   Hernandez played for Belichick and the Patriots from 2010 to 2013. The
   former star tight end is being tried in [33]the drive-by slayings of
   29-year-old Daniel de Abreu and 28-year-old Safiro Furtado. Both men
   were shot to death as they left a Boston nightclub back in 2012.
   Prosecutors say Hernandez shot them after one spilled a drink on him at
   a club. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty.
