   A group of Americans living in Mexico is planning a protest Thursday to
   send a message to visiting U.S. Secretary of State [14]Rex Tillerson .

   Their gripe?

   President Trump’s "inflammatory rhetoric."

   That's according to a draft of a letter that several groups organizing
   the protest hope to deliver to Tillerson, who is [15]in town along with
   Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly for talks with top Mexican
   officials.

   The letter, which will be cosigned by the Mexican chapter of Democrats
   Abroad, as well as other groups, complains about Trump's "hostile"
   attitude toward Mexico, which it says is engendering "nationalistic
   sentiments" in Mexico.

   Among Trump's hostile acts, the letter says, is Trump's vow to build a
   border wall and force Mexico to pay for it.

   "The idea of building a wall ... frames Mexico and Mexicans as foreign
   invaders," the letter says.

   It also criticizes Trump for pledging to renegotiate NAFTA,  saying,
   "The U.S. and Mexico are deeply connected economies and it is in the
   interest of the United States to strengthen the regional
   production network to boost manufacturing employment in the U.S. and
   ensure the long-run competitiveness of manufacturing in the region."

   There are more than a million U.S. citizens living in Mexico, and
   many have been vocal since Trump's election. Last month, thousands
   turned out for a women's march outside the American Embassy that saw
   crowds chanting anti-Trump slogans.
