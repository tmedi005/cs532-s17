Patriots tight end won't visit Trump White House

   At least one member of the New England Patriots won’t be visiting the
   White House if President Trump invites the team to celebrate its Super
   Bowl victory.

   Martellus Bennett, the team’s outspoken tight end, said he will not
   show up at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. as a guest of Trump.

   “I’m not going to go,” Bennett told reporters Sunday night after the
   Patriots’ [145]historic comeback victory over the Atlanta Falcons.

   Asked why, he responded, “like I said, you know, it is what it is.
   People know how I feel about it. Just follow me on Twitter.”

   The nine-year NFL veteran endorsed [146]Hillary Clinton [147]Hillary

   [150]Clinton taunts GOP lawmakers for dodging town halls [151]MORE in
   the 2016 election and has repeatedly criticized Trump. He said earlier
   this week he likely would not show up at a White House celebration if
   his team won.

   “I don’t support the guy that’s in the house," [152]Bennett said when
   asked to explain.

   “America was built on inclusiveness not exclusiveness,” [153]Bennett
   tweeted last month.

   Among his teammates, Bennett could be taking a lonely stand against
   trump. Patriots owner Robert Kraft and quarterback Tom Brady are both
   [154]personal friends of the president.
