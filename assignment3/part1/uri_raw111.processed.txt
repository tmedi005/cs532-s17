[72]Tom Brady has a suspect board for his missing Super Bowl jersey (and his
Patriots teammates are on it!)

   [75]This article originally appeared on SI.com

   Tom Brady is taking the case of his missing jersey into his own hands.

   The Patriots quarterback Instagrammed a suspect board including a
   diverse group of potential culprits, including Jaws, Lady Gaga and
   Julian Edelman.


   [76]Hey @edelman11 "Ya suspect, yeah you! I don't know what your
   reputation is in this town, but after that s@?# you pulled, you can bet
   l'll be looking into you!"

   A post shared by Tom Brady (@tombrady) on
   Feb 22, 2017 at 8:39am PST

   The caption reads: “Hey @edelman11 ‘Ya suspect, yeah you! I don’t know
   what your reputation is in this town, but after that s@?# you pulled,
   you can bet l’ll be looking into you!'”

   Brady’s #12 jersey [77]disappeared from the locker room at NRG Stadium
   shortly after the Patriots won Super Bowl LI. Despite a pretty
   widespread effort to locate the jersey, the case remains unsolved.
   Houston police valued the stolen jersey at $500,000, according to a
   police report [78]obtained by TMZ.

   Brady is not particularly funny in interviews, but he’s quite the
   [79]self-deprecating jokester on Instagram.

   I guess it’s easy to poke fun of yourself when you’ve won five Super
   Bowls and are married to a super model.
