Patriots coach could be called as witness in Aaron Hernandez murder trial

   Posted on [53]February 23, 2017 by [54]1 NEWS

   BOSTON — [55]New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick could be
   called as a witness in the double murder trial of [56]Aaron Hernandez,
   according to court documents released Wednesday,[57] CBS Boston
   reports.

   Belichick’s name appeared on a list of possible witnesses filed Tuesday
   by Hernandez’s defense.

   Hernandez played for Belichick and the Patriots from 2010 to 2013. The
   former star tight end is being tried in [58]the drive-by slayings of
   29-year-old Daniel de Abreu and 28-year-old Safiro Furtado. Both men
   were shot to death as they left a Boston nightclub back in 2012.
   Prosecutors say Hernandez shot them after one spilled a drink on him at
   a club. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty.

   There are dozens of potential civilian and expert witnesses listed on
   the new defense filing. “William Belichick, Hingham, MA” is No. 11.

   Earlier in the month, a defense motion said Patriots offensive
   coordinator Josh McDaniels may testify on the possible meanings of some
   of Hernandez’s tattoos.

   WBZ-TV Sports Director Steve Burton is also listed as a potential
   witness in the court paperwork. The documents cite Steve’s 2011
   interview with Hernandez.

   Jury selection is underway. Opening statements are scheduled March 1.

   Hernandez grew up in Connecticut. He is serving a life sentence in the
   2013 [59]killing of Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of
   Hernandez’s fiancee.
