   We at the Center for Security Policy feel it is important for Americans
   to better understand– and, then, be able to successfully contend with–
   those that attempt to destroy or subvert our way of life. As making our
   nation’s enemies’ threat doctrines available is a key part of our
   educational efforts, we are pleased to present the blueprint for the
   Muslim Brotherhood in America, known as [42]An Explanatory Memorandum:
   On the General Strategic Goal for the Group in North America or, in
   America’s largest terrorist prosecution in US federal court, Government
   Exhibit 003-0085 3:04-CR-240-G in U.S. v Holy Land Foundation, et al.

   [44]Explanatory_Cover-web2 In August of 2004, an alert Maryland
   Transportation Authority Police officer observed a woman wearing
   traditional Islamic garb videotaping the support structures of the
   Chesapeake Bay Bridge, and conducted a traffic stop. The driver was
   Ismail Elbarasse and detained on an outstanding material witness
   warrant issued in Chicago in connection with fundraising for Hamas.The
   FBI’s Washington Field Office subsequently executed a search warrant on
   Elbarasse’s residence in Annandale, Virginia. In the basement of his
   home, a hidden sub-basement was found; it revealed over 80 banker boxes
   of the archives of the Muslim Brotherhood in North America. One of the
   most important of these documents made public to date was entered into
   evidence during the Holy Land Foundation trial. It amounted to the
   Muslim Brotherhood’s strategic plan for the United States and was
   entitled, “An Explanatory Memorandum: On the General Strategic Goal for
   the Group in North America.” The Explanatory Memorandum was written in
   1991 by a member of the Board of Directors for the Muslim Brotherhood
   in North America and senior Hamas leader named Mohammed Akram. It had
   been approved by the Brotherhood’s Shura Council and Organizational
   Conference and was meant for internal review by the Brothers’
   leadership in Egypt. It was certainly not intended for public
   consumption, particularly in the targeted society: the United States.
   For these reasons, the memo constitutes a Rosetta stone for the Muslim
   Brotherhood, its goals, modus operandi and infrastructure in America.
   It is arguably the single most important vehicle for understanding a
   secretive organization and should, therefore, be considered required
   reading for policy-makers and the public, alike.

   Another extraordinarily important element of the Memorandum is its
   attachment. Under the heading “ A List of Our Organizations and
   Organizations of Our Friends,” Akram helpfully identified 29 groups as
   Muslim Brotherhood fronts. Many of them are even now, some twenty-two
   years later, still among the most prominent Muslim- American
   organizations in the United States. Worryingly, the senior
   representatives of these groups are routinely identified by U.S.
   officials as “leaders” of the Muslim community in this country, to be
   treated as “partners” in “countering violent extremism” and other
   outreach initiatives. Obviously, this list suggests such treatment
   translates into vehicles for deep penetration of the American
   government and civil society.

   We urge the readers of this pamphlet to share it with others— family
   members, friends, business associates and most especially those in a
   position to help adopt policies that will secure our country against
   the threat posed by shariah and its most effective and aggressive
   promoters, the Muslim Brotherhood.

   More about the Explanatory Memorandum (from [45]Shariah: The Threat to
   America):

     The following Muslim Brotherhood document was entered into evidence
     in the U.S. v Holy Land Foundation trial, and is a primary source
     threat document that provides new insights into global jihad
     organizations like the Muslim Brotherhood. These documents (covered
     extensively in chapter four) define the structure and outline of
     domestic jihad threat entities, associated non-governmental
     organizations and potential terrorist or insurgent support systems.
     The Memorandum also describes aspects of the global jihad’s
     strategic information warfare campaign and indications of its
     structure, reach and activities. It met evidentiary standards to be
     admissible as evidence in a Federal Court of law .

     In the original document, the first 16 pages are in the original
     Arabic and the second are English translations of the same. It is
     dated May 22, 1991 and titled “ An Explanatory Memorandum on the
     General Strategic Goal for the Group in North America” (Memorandum).
     The document includes an Attachment 1 that contains “a list of our
     organizations and the organizations of our friends.”

     The Memorandum expressly recognizes the Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan)
     as the controlling element of these organizations and expressly
     identifies the Muslim Brotherhood as the leadership element in
     implementing the strategic goals. The Memorandum is reproduced here
     in its official Federal Court translation, as Government Exhibit
     003-0085 3:04-CR-240-G in U.S. v Holy Land Foundation, et al. with
     punctuation, line spacing and spelling intact.

   From the [46]Explanatory Memorandum— the Muslim Brotherhood in America
   in its own words:

     “The process of settlement is a ‘Civilization-Jihadist Process’ with
     all the word means. The Ikhwan [Muslim Brotherhood] must understand
     that their work in America is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating
     and destroying the Western civilization from within and “sabotaging”
     its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so
     that it is eliminated and God’s religion is made victorious over all
     other religions.”
