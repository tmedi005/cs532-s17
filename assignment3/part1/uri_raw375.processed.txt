     * [19]AFC free agency fits
     * [20]NFC free agency fits

   Free agency doesn't start until March 9. While waiting for the
   franchise tags to be applied and roster cuts to be made, Gregg
   Rosenthal couldn't help but dream of the frenzied first few days of
   signings. Below: one fun player addition for every AFC team.

   Baltimore Ravens: [21]Logan Ryan, cornerback

   Look for [22]Ravens GM Ozzie Newsome to be active this offseason. He
   has concerns at every level of the defense and can't rely on the draft
   to fill them all. Re-signing nose tackle [23]Brandon Williams should be
   priority one. Once that's accomplished, how about stealing Ryan from
   the [24]Patriots? Former New England coordinator Dean Pees prizes
   physicality, and Ryan is one of the best tackling cornerbacks in
   football, with the ability to play inside and out. He won't come cheap
   after a great postseason run.

   Buffalo Bills: [25]Tony Jefferson, safety

   New [26]Bills coach Sean McDermott has a terrific track record with
   safeties who can do a little bit of everything. (He tutored relative
   unknown [27]Eagles safety Quintin Mikell to make second-team All-Pro
   and helped castoff [28]Kurt Coleman earn big coin in Carolina.)
   Jefferson can be deployed in a variety of ways, making big plays near
   the line of scrimmage or in coverage. He makes a lot of sense for a
   team that could be starting from scratch at safety.

   Cincinnati Bengals: [29]Andrew Whitworth, offensive tackle

   [30]Bengals owner Mike Brown rarely goes for a big free-agent splash.
   That would likely rule out shoring up the team's defensive line with a
   run-stopper like Philadelphia's [31]Bennie Logan, so I'm going with a
   more familiar name. The [32]Bengals drafted tackles [33]Cedric Ogbuehi
   and [34]Jake Fisher to take over the position, but both of them
   disappointed in 2016. Whitworth, a [35]Bengals starter since 2006, has
   more value to Cincinnati than any other organization [36]except PFF.

   Cleveland Browns: [37]T.J. McDonald, safety

   Cleveland's safety depth chart is nearly as barren as the quarterback
   room, and new defensive coordinator Gregg Williams could bring in a
   familiar face from the [38]Rams. McDonald is a rangy strong safety with
   four years of starting experience -- and he just turned 26 a month ago.
   He could help establish the physical play that defines Williams'
   defenses, for good and bad.

   Denver Broncos: [39]Tony Romo, quarterback

   The [40]Broncos remain the cleanest landing spot for Romo this
   offseason because they don't need him. The low cost and potential of
   [41]Trevor Siemian and [42]Paxton Lynch is a combination that will
   allow John Elway to wait out Dallas' attempts to trade Romo and drive a
   hard bargain. Denver can just sit back and see if Romo eventually gets
   released. This is where John Elway's swing and miss with [43]Brock
   Osweiler last offseason pays off again. It's too hard to imagine the
   [44]Texans finding the money for Romo when they still owe Osweiler $16
   million guaranteed. Other potential suitors for Romo -- like Buffalo
   and Chicago -- need to fill their quarterback holes fast and could be
   unappealing destinations for Romo, who has made plenty of money in his
   career and should be looking for the best chance at a title. That's in
   Denver.

   Houston Texans: [45]Martellus Bennett, tight end

   Add another name to the New England-Houston pipeline? A tight end, like
   Bennett, who can block and catch would improve coach Bill O'Brien's
   offensive options, with the team also able to deploy [46]C.J.
   Fiedorowicz. Bennett, a Houston native who just won a [47]Super Bowl in
   the city, would add another dimension to a nice group of skill-position
   players. (If you just ignore that tricky quarterback position.)

   Indianapolis Colts: [48]Melvin Ingram, linebacker

   No team should be more desperate for pass-rush help than Indianapolis.
   No better pass rusher than Ingram is likely to become available. It's
   uncertain if Ingram now fits in Los Angeles with the [49]Chargers
   changing schemes, but that isn't a question with the [50]Colts. Ingram
   would be trading one Pagano (John, his former coordinator in San Diego)
   for another.

   Jacksonville Jaguars: [51]Branden Albert, offensive tackle

   Miami was all set to release Albert ... when suddenly, the team called
   an audible. NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reported Friday that [52]the
   Jaguars are considered "the primary destination" for Albert, who
   figures to arrive in Jacksonville in a trade. NFL Network Insider Ian
   Rapoport reported Monday that [53]Albert is visiting the Jaguars. This
   potential trade wouldn't be announced until the start of the new league
   year on March 9, at the earliest, and it would come with significant
   risk. Albert, 32, will cost $8.875 million and has struggled with
   injuries. He's a high-risk, high-reward short-term fix for a team that
   strangely remains all in on [54]Blake Bortles.

   Kansas City Chiefs: [55]Dont'a Hightower, linebacker

   Some team is going to pay Hightower a lot of money this offseason,
   because the inside linebacker market falls off a cliff after him. It
   might be difficult for the [56]Chiefs to pull it off because of their
   salary-cap situation, but general manager John Dorsey could make room
   if he truly wanted to. Kansas City was surprisingly stale in the front
   seven last season, especially at the linebacker position. Hightower
   will provide leadership and the flexibility to line up in any formation
   with any team that signs him.

   Los Angeles Chargers: [57]T.J. Lang, offensive guard

   GM Tom Telesco is going to be hunting for two to three O-line starters
   this offseason and could use help at any position. While the
   [58]Packers don't like paying 29-year-old guards superstar money,
   Telesco doesn't have the same luxury. He's looking to make up for the
   mistakes of free agency past, like guard [59]Orlando Franklin.

   Miami Dolphins: [60]Dre Kirkpatrick, cornerback

   [61]Dolphins cornerback [62]Byron Maxwell believes Miami's secondary is
   only [63]a nickname away from greatness. Another quality cornerback
   would help a lot more. New defensive coordinator Matt Burke was with
   Kirkpatrick in Cincinnati and knows he's a solid starter. Few teams
   like to pay big bucks in free agency for solid starters more than the
   [64]Dolphins.

   New England Patriots: [65]Eddie Lacy, running back

   A talented between-the-tackles running back who struggled with weight
   issues and could be willing to accept a low-cost deal to reset his NFL
   value. That once was [66]LeGarrette Blount, and it now describes Lacy,
   four years younger than Blount with a higher ceiling.

   New York Jets: [74]Mike Glennon, quarterback

   [75]Jets GM Mike Maccagnan [76]reportedly showed interest in Glennon
   for a possible trade in 2015, and the team's quarterback need is even
   more desperate now. While he took a step back in his second season,
   Glennon put up the 19th-best total QBR with 29 TDs and 15 INTs between
   2013 and 2014 while playing for three disastrous Bucs coordinators:
   Mike Sullivan, Jeff Tedford and Marcus Arroyo. Signing Glennon would
   offer the [77]Jets an ideal combination of experience, potential and
   youth. The price tag remains to be seen.

   Oakland Raiders: [78]Calais Campbell, defensive tackle

   Campbell could improve virtually any team needing muscle up front.
   There just aren't many 6-foot-8, 300-pound defensive linemen possessing
   position versatility and veteran leadership smarts like Campbell.
   Despite his spending in recent years, [79]Raiders GM Reggie McKenzie
   still has plenty of room to work with to address a major need on his
   interior defensive line.

   Pittsburgh Steelers: [80]Prince Amukamara, cornerback

   GM Kevin Colbert dipped his toe in free agency last season with tight
   end [81]Ladarius Green and offensive tackle [82]Ryan Harris. Those
   moves didn't pan out, but that shouldn't stop Pittsburgh from looking
   for value in the secondary. Since the [83]Steelers are unlikely to make
   a big splash, Amukamara makes sense as a cornerback who could eat up
   quality snaps at a reasonable price.

   Tennessee Titans: [84]A.J. Bouye, cornerback

   If the [85]Texans don't use the franchise tag on Bouye, he could wind
   up making top-10 cornerback money. The [86]Titans make a logical fit
   because they have too much cap room, a desperate need at cornerback and
   saw Bouye play great against them twice this past season.
