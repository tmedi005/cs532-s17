[9]Jimmy Garoppolo Watch: Report Indicates “Several Teams” Are Readying a
Blockbuster Offer

   Trading for Jimmy Garoppolo would not only impact the future of any
   given franchise, it would also shake up the entire upcoming NFL Draft.

   [16]Over at Bleacher Report, Mike Freeman writes that a blockbuster
   trade headlined by Tom Brady’s backup in New England is exactly the
   kind of thing that could be a game-changer on multiple levels.

   And moreover, Freeman says he is hearing that several teams are lining
   up and preparing to make blockbuster trade offers to the Patriots for
   Garoppolo.

   The increasing belief around the league, Freeman says, is that some
   believe Garoppolo is a transcendent talent who is worthy of [giving up]
   a first-round pick.

   That seems to be a belief based on desperation in a league where there
   are more quarterback openings than there are suitable quarterbacks to
   fill them. Further, it is a hope that three seasons under Brady, Bill
   Belichick, and offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels will help a player
   with only 94 career passes on his resume translate into a leading man.

   The Browns, 49ers, Jets, and Bills are among the [17]teams with top-10
   picks who could fulfill New England’s needs in a trade. In fact,
   Cleveland has a second first-rounder (12th overall) it can dangle in a
   deal, as well. Of course, a team could always emerge from the back of
   the pack and wow the Patriots in a trade.

   New Orleans coach Sean Payton [18]says his team is always in the hunt
   for a quarterback, while Denver – which owns the 20th pick – would be
   the kind of team in a position to take on the risk of dealing a
   first-round pick because of the high-end talent the team has at other
   skill positions.

   And, of course, as owners of the third overall pick, the Chicago Bears
   would be among those teams in a position to make such a blockbuster
   deal.

   Further, if the Bears went all-in on a deal that sent the third overall
   pick in the upcoming NFL Draft to New England, it would be the first
   time a team dealt a top-10 pick for a quarterback since Buffalo traded
   the ninth pick to Jacksonville in 1999 for backup Rob Johnson. That
   pick went on to become running back Fred Taylor, a 2007 Pro Bowler who
   had seven 1,000-yard rushing seasons.

   It takes two to tango in any blockbuster deal, but only one – like the
   Bears – has to have a high pick.
