   TROY, N.Y. >> Harry Gully, the face of Lansingburgh Pop Warner and the
   Troy Patriots for more than 45 years, died Monday at the age of 82
   according to the organization.

   “He loved teaching and coaching all of your children, and the Troy
   Patriots was an extension of his own family,” the Troy Patriots posted
   on Facebook. “He was proud of this organization, and it kept him going
   through his own family struggles. He was loved by many, but will be
   missed by all. The Lansingburgh community, as well as many Pop Warner
   programs throughout the area, were much better because of Mr. Gully.
   For all that Mr. Gully did, we simply say, ‘Thank you.’”

   The Lansingburgh organization formed in 1962 but Gully didn’t get
   involved until 1965. More than four decades — and thousands of players
   — later, he was still helping out in any way he could.

   “Winning and losing, to me, it doesn’t matter,” Gully told a Record
   reporter in 2009. “It doesn’t mean anything in the long run. Giving the
   (opportunity) of playing, sportsmanship, meeting new people, making
   friends, helping kids in school ... I wouldn’t care if we never won a
   game as long as these kids learned something about growing up and being
   a good person. Then if you do get the (big) win, that’s like whipped
   cream on top of the ice cream.”

   Troy High varsity football coach Bob Burns and former Catholic Central
   coach Mark Galuski played for Gully. Both remembered the Troy Patriots
   uniforms being nicer than their high school uniforms, and how Gully
   would help kids get cleats if they didn’t have them and couldn’t afford
   them.

   Burns texted several childhood friends this morning that he hadn’t
   talked to in years. He expects wake and services to be one of the
   biggest turnouts ever in Lansingburgh.

   “There’s one thing in particular that I remember him telling me that I
   still tell to my kids this day,” Burns said. “Whenever you’re going to
   make a decision to choose to do something right or wrong — just think,
   if your mother was standing there next to you, would you still make the
   same decision. I still use that line when I coach today. That’s
   something I remember him saying to me when I was 12-years-old.”

   Galuski remained very close with Gully, who had dementia. He visited
   him in the hospital. And he also introduced Gully when he was inducted
   into the Albany football Hall of Fame.

   “As soon as I started playing football, I fell in love with the game,”
   Galuski said. “I think it’s a tribute to how Mr. Gully handled things
   and what he taught us as young guys. Back in those days, you got
   pressed. There was a lot more of the corporal discipline, a lot more
   military-type discipline. But he was always a guy, that, no matter what
   happened, he was always a supporter.”

   Gully also made an impact outside of sports. Gully and his wife,
   Marilyn played the part of Santa and Mrs. Claus since their marriage.
   The couple decorated their front lawn, at 644 Fifth Ave. in
   Lansingburgh, in anticipation of hundreds of children and their
   families who faithfully turned out to ask for presents each year.

   A wake celebrating Gully’s life is scheduled for Friday from 3-7 p.m.
   at McLoughlin & Mason Funeral Home located at 3rd Ave and 109th St. in
   Troy. A funeral mass will be Saturday morning at 9 a.m. at St.
   Augustine Church.
