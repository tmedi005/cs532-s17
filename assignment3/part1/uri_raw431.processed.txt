   [138]Super Bowl

The Winners of USA Today's Super Bowl Ad Meter Are ...

   Published on February 06, 2017.

   [139]Kia's "Hero's Journey" has been crowned the most popular ad from
   Super Bowl LI by online panelists in USA Today's annual Super Bowl Ad
   Meter.

   Ad Meter ratings opened on the Wednesday before the game this year in a
   reflection of the many, many Super Bowl ads already circulating online.
   The results reflect the average rating that voters gave ads on a range
   from 1 to 10. The 5 top-rated ads were:

   1. Kia's "Hero's Journey"
   Rating: 7.47

   2. Honda "Yearbooks"
   Rating: 6.96

   3. Audi "Daughter"
   Rating: 6.87

   4. Budweiser "Born the Hard Way"
   Rating: 6.84

   5. Tide "#Bradshaw Stain"
   Rating: 6.77

   See[140] the full results here.

   Now [141]vote in Ad Age's own poll. We want to know which ad best
   combined entertainment, craft and brand goals.
