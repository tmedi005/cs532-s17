Sessions, DeVos And Patriots: How To Win When Nothing Makes Sense

   This post was almost called "Make Black History Black Again." Believe
   it or not, we are only 20 days into this new Administration, and I have
   reshifted my partial sew-in more times than I care to admit. We have
   all bore witness to the aggressive slaughtering of our Nation, which
   barely missed hell thanks to the Williams' sisters, Beyonce's
   pregnancy, and James Baldwin still speaking to and through us in the
   must-see cinematic prose "I Am Not Your Negro" (surely February
   deserves one more calendar day just for that title alone).

   After witnessing delusional inauguration photo interpretations,
   censoring of reporters, discriminatory travel bans, confirmations of
   underqualified elitists, sightings of deceased abolitionists, the
   silencing of the late Coretta Scott King via Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and
   a major threat to healthcare coverage nationwide, I have one message to
   Democrats: You're not gonna win with common sense alone.

   I am in no way suggesting anarchy, but I am suggesting a real
   reevaluation of strategies and tactics. For starters, it appears that
   Dems are in a little bit of a numerical quagmire. Republicans control
   both chambers of Congress, the White House, and now the Departments of
   Justice and Education, and soon to be the Supreme Court. Not to mention
   that our State Department is now owned by Exxon, Texas Gov. Rick Perry
   is actually considered for...anything...and once Trump opponent Sen.
   Lindsey Graham has uttered "Make America Great Again." Is there no balm
   in Gilead?

   Dems, you're outnumbered but not just because you don't have the votes
   to pass legislation. But because the Republicans take pacts. And they
   take those things just as seriously as Atlanta Housewife Cynthia Bailey
   takes her friend contracts. Remember how serious it was when former
   Republican presidential candidates were hesitant to say whether they'd
   back the presumptive nominee? The response was always "it would be a
   disgrace if so and so didn't back the nominee. We all made a pact!"
   See, pacts are real sophomoric, like "pinky swears." Except for when
   they're honored by everyone. Then, these impenetrable bonds have power
   and are exactly why you Dems stay scratching your head because your
   once GOP-bestie is now acting like y'all ain't never worked out in the
   same Congressional gym.

   Face it: conservatives individual feelings towards Donald Trump will
   not overpower their invisible pact to look the other way and push
   forward their agenda. So, don't waste too much time reasoning with
   them.

   That's not to say that there won't be outliers from time to time.
   Senators Lisa Murkowski (AK) and Susan Collins (ME) voted against the
   nomination of now confirmed head of the Department of Education, Betsy
   DeVos. But the subsequent Attorney General confirmation of Sen.
   Jefferson Beauregard Sessions a day later once again proves that
   Republicans do not care about patterns of injustice, facts, or the will
   of the people. They have the power to do what they want to do. And they
   will use it.

   Republicans have been perfecting this power stance for almost a decade,
   taking every opportunity to obstruct the desires of the people of
   America by obstructing the candidate the people elected,
   twice--President Barack Obama. They did not succumb to being labeled
   the "do-nothing" Congress when they were in the majority. They didn't
   care how many millions our Nation lost when they shut down the
   government. And they definitely could care less that every night, cable
   news networks listed their discretions.

   They made a pact, remember.

   And because they wouldn't let up, we started to normalize this
   dysfunction and treat it as government. The Tea Party, which was at one
   time synonymous as crazy, is now spelled GOP. Which left room for the
   arrival of a problematic, litigation-ladened, never governed, now
   President Donald Trump. And now, folks are wondering if we really have
   to wait until 2020 to take action.

   The short answer is: we can't wait. And to get a little sanity, we got
   to get a little crazy first. I do believe you, Dems, when you say that
   the people will answer in 2018 and 2020. But using old tools on this
   new journey is not going to get us there. I offer these five starter
   suggestions:

   Resolve now that "political petty" is a viable tactic. Political petty
   is a step up from traditional petty in that it is reserved for elected
   officials who have no regard to the feelings of the opposing party,
   pursuant to an intended outcome. Sen. Ted Cruz is a political petty
   master, showing that he will hold up a Senate floor all by himself for
   twenty-one hours, vowing to "speak in support of defunding Obamacare
   until I am no longer able to stand." (so poetic, right?) Political
   pettiness causes sensationalism, which results in huge coverage, and
   ultimately viewership--especially by everyday people who only tune in
   to news when an outrageous moment is captured. Political pettiness can
   be best felt when a critical mass of electeds employ it. One idea is to
   have every Dem elected start every interview with a statement like "In
   3 years, 11 months, 3 days, 12 hours, and 53 seconds the American
   people are going to fire Trump." Trust me, you do that every day, we'll
   listen. (This site helps you keep track of the exact amount of time).

   Get yourselves a real good messenger (and message). We laughed when
   Kellyanne Conway used the term "alternative facts" to describe the lies
   (which are the opposite of "facts") that were spewing out of the Trump
   Administration. But considering that now "alternative facts" has its
   own Wikipedia page, I'd say she won that battle. And part of the genius
   of her presence is that she is not the President. Face time is an
   extremely important tool for elected Dems, especially in the House of
   Representatives, where guaranteed tenure is for two years at a time.
   But Dems should consider employing a face that can resonate your
   collective strategy, stay on message, and afford to make a couple
   mistakes. I trust you Dems will leverage your incoming Chair to take
   this role, but an additional surrogate may not hurt. (And if you
   combine strategies one and two, you can even hold your own weekly Dem
   Press Conference to counter all the alternative facts from the past
   week. See how political petty works?)

   Do not over rely on cable news. Get on more non-traditional outlets,
   and perhaps more importantly do things untraditionally. Pull out your
   camera phone while walking to the car and let us know your unscripted
   thoughts about the ongoing attacks on liberties, destruction of
   freedom, and normalized bigotry from the highest seat in the Nation.
   Rep. Maxine Waters did one recently right outside elevators in one of
   the Congressional buildings, proving that almost no spot or time is a
   bad one. I suggest you don't do it in the shower or you know...with no
   shirt on. But a slip of a curse word here or there is quite alright. We
   survived pussygate...so we can handle passionate four letter words from
   time to time. Which leads me to my next point.

   Keep the Rising American Electorate energized and engaged! You may have
   heard the term the "rising electorate" but who are they are where are
   they rising from? The rising American electorate (RAE) is the term to
   describe the rapidly growing group of unmarried women, millennials and
   non-white voters. Decade-long projections proved to be correct this
   past election cycle as this group emerged as the majority of voters, at
   55 percent. Majority of this demographic supported Hillary Clinton and
   has probably already been targeted by Trump. What does this mean? Get
   more Cardi B's as your messengers so they can speak organically to your
   voters! And do some more in-person events in local venues and hot
   spots. This ain't your "Meet the Press" crowd.

   Some of y'all have to leave Congress. This may be where I lost some
   consulting coins. But hear me out. There were two things that really
   stood out to me during the 2010 midterm elections as a staffer in
   Congress: the age of tea party candidates and the "one-term" messaging.
   With a more fresh and green appearance, the Tea Partiers came in with
   more room to make mistakes, especially when so many ran on message of
   leaving after just one-term. In a nation growing quite resentful of a
   lack of political options, you Dems must ask yourselves this key
   question: Are you really as effective as you used to be? Or put another
   way: Can America win more with new blood in Congress? I suggest the
   Dems not only embrace this, but also embrace a real pipeline that is
   less of a stepping down and more of a baton pass. If America were to
   see a cohort of you guy say "You know what, we love what we do and we
   will serve in other ways. But we see the value of endorsing the new
   wave of representatives in 2018," I think we will finally get a little
   closer to using the greatness within America to finally make her great
   for us all.

   To be clear, Standing Rock is still fighting for their rights, Black
   lives are still threatened every day, and there's still no clean water
   in Flint. So this should not be seen as the end-all, but some new balls
   to juggle in the air. It should be noted that most your top strategists
   have been wrong as of late. This is just a plea from a regular,
   "shmegular" citizen to please try something new.
