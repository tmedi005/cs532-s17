   There is a war waging for the soul of America. Melania Trump took the
   microphone at President Trump’s [21]Florida rally to declare which side
   of that war her family is on:

   Let us pray. Three simple, beautiful words. This was more than just a
   call to honor our Creator. It was a declaration of war against the
   enemies of God who have entrenched themselves in the mountains of
   media, entertainment and government. After eight years of godlessness
   and ridicule the Trump family has reasserted the importance of God in
   every day American life.

   And the Left is not happy:

   Let us pray

   The Left has always abused the English language. They have
   [23]redefined racism so that it’s exclusively a platform of
   “whiteness”. Then they expanded the boundaries of rape to include
   consensual acts. Now, since the election of President Trump, they’ve
   determined anyone who stands against their [24]agenda of death is a
   “fascist.”

   This level of decisive arrogance is nothing new either and further
   proves that the Left has moved away from all platforms of meaningful
   debate. Their solution to every situation is to scream talking points,
   insults and threaten violence. They spent the better part of this year
   [25]advocating that it’s acceptable to physically assault “Nazis” and
   now they are broadening the definition to include every day Christian
   Americans who support the President of the United States.

   This culture war was prominent during the Obama regime. Under the
   Department of Homeland Security [26]Christians were ranked as a higher
   threat than Muslims, a foolish stance that the Trump administration has
   since reversed. But that is how the Left views you. Your desire for a
   safe and secure nation with a rich economy and culture is indicative of
   “fascism”. A word, which like racist and rape, they have hijacked to
   fit a Marxist agenda. It creates an atmosphere in which we cannot
   debate these people. In their eyes we’re already the enemy. We are the
   “brownshirts”, a contrarian force that believes in a God that they
   reject. We stand no more of a chance of recruiting these Communists to
   our righteous cause than they have in convincing us to abandon our
   faith and Western culture.

   With that in mind we must turn our attention from debate to our works.
   We must drag these people into a better America kicking and screaming
   if necessary. Melania Trump’s prayer was for more than the soul of
   America. It was also a declaration of our intent to move forward in
   spite of the caustic elements which are attempting to hold us back.

   The [27]Patheos article above ended up with an unsourced quote: ““When
   fascism comes to America it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a
   cross.” I believe the following from Sir Winston Churchill to be more
   accurate:

   Pray for the Trump family. Pray for America. Pray for each other. This
   fight is just beginning.
