   The first football game I ever watched was the 2001 Super Bowl victory
   by the New England Patriots over the best team in the league that year,
   the St. Louis Rams.

   That win helped begin what has been an uninterrupted success. Since
   that 2001 victory, the Patriots have been to the playoffs 13 out of 15
   years, have had nine Semi-Final Appearances, seven Finals Appearances
   and four League Championships.

   Since [1]co-founding my own start-up at Exact Media, I've come to
   appreciate the organization that is the New England Patriots even more
   than the team itself.

   The Patriots are the picture of stability in a league filled with
   constant change. It's a great parallel to what it feels like to build a
   company.

   After following this team for 15 years, there are five lessons from
   this organization that I continue to embrace in my daily life.

   Lesson #1: Do your job. But stay flexible enough to take on new jobs
   quickly

   "[2]Do your job" is something Belichick says constantly to refocus his
   team's efforts on the field.

   It means complete your assignments, execute to the best of your ability
   and trust that your teammates will do the same. In a company, that is
   the only way a team can be successful.

   But the Patriots take it a step further. With the Patriots your job may
   change from week to week.

   It may be a subtle change, such as focusing on running the football
   versus throwing passes.

   Or it may be drastic, like changing your position mid-season. Receivers
   Troy Brown and Julian Edelman were asked to switch from playing offence
   to playing defense when that's what the team needed.

   In life, the only thing that is certain in the future is that things
   will change.

   The Patriots are built to embrace change. Your team should be too.

   Lesson #2: Play the long game

   During his first coaching stint in Cleveland, Belichick believed in
   developing talent from within and took a long view in building his
   organization.

   [3]In his book "War Room," author Michael Holley says, "[Belichick]
   believed in developing scouts and coaches by hiring them for
   entry-level positions and then seeing if they could graduate from
   unofficial apprenticeships."

   In the 2017 Super Bowl, Belichick's team is going up against the
   Atlanta Falcons, led by Thomas Dimitroff and Scott Pioli, two members
   of his staff who he trained and developed over 15 years.

   When evaluating players, Belichick cares only about their future
   potential production. He often cuts popular veterans and replaces them
   with more cost-effective options that will benefit the team for a
   longer period of time.

   Belichick ignores media scrutiny and does what is best for the
   organization, so it will succeed.

   Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, is a perfect example of how this is applied
   in the business world. [4]He doesn't care what Wall Street thinks of
   their quarterly earnings, and he doesn't show up to the quarterly
   conference calls. He's focused on the long-term too.

   Lesson #3: Push your top performers, use them to set an example

   Former Patriots Receiver Chad Johnson[5] compares Bill Belichick to the
   drill sergeant from "Full Metal Jacket." During Chad's first day with
   the team in 2011, Belichick started the meeting by chastising the poor
   performance of Tom Brady, their starting quarterback, best player and
   future Hall of Famer. He blamed it for the team's exit from the
   playoffs the previous season.

   Pushing even their best player to be better set the tone for the rest
   of the organization.

   "I believe to have a championship team you want to have a championship
   team in every area, whether that's your starting quarterback, your
   strength coach, your medical staff, your area scouts, whatever it
   happens to be," [6]Belichick said during his near 40-minute address.
   "We're trying to work at a championship level of performance in every
   one of those areas."

   If you show that your [7]best employees are still continuously pushed
   to improve, it makes it clear to the entire organization that the bar
   is set high. This leads to quality output.

   Lesson #4: Put your team members in the best position to succeed

   [8]Bill Belichick often says to scouts, "Tell me what the guy can do,
   don't tell me what he can't do, and we'll find a way to put that
   positive skill set in the defense and not ask him to be in a position
   where he can fail."

   The Patriots coaching staff has been incredibly successful at finding
   players no one else wants and turning them into [9]stars.

   A great example of the effectiveness of their system is [10]Stephen
   Neal. He was a wrestler and hadn't played football since high school
   until he joined the New England Patriots. They turned him into a
   three-time Super Bowl Champion.

   In your organization, make sure you're investing in building robust
   training, development and retention systems. It's important to know how
   to use the talent at your disposal, and also to have systems in place
   to train and develop new team members so they can succeed.

   Lesson #5: Respect your competition

   Before every game, [11]Belichick praises the competition, no matter how
   poor their record may be.

   As a leader, Belichick knows that past performance is not necessarily
   indicative of future results, though effort and participation can help.

   Reminding his team that the competition is getting better every day
   mitigates the complacency and laziness that can come with success.

   Ensure that your team continues to have respect for the opposition so
   they continue to put in the work that made them winners in the first
   place.
