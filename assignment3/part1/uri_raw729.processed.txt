Patriots Coach Bill Belichick Could Be Called As Witness In Aaron Hernandez
Murder Trial « CBS Boston

   BOSTON (CBS) — New evidence in the upcoming Aaron Hernandez double
   murder trial has been released, including transcripts from jailhouse
   cellphone conversations and a lengthy potential defense witness list
   that includes Patriots coach Bill Belichick.

   The list contains nearly 270 names, and Belichick is listed as number
   11.

   He was also on the potential witness list when Hernandez was first
   tried and convicted for the murder of Odin Lloyd, but Belichick was
   never called.

   “Ninety-eight percent of them will not be called,” said lawful expert
   Harry Manion. “What a defendant does in all trials, and especially
   murder one trials, is name the conceivable universe.”

   Manion sees only a limited circumstance this time around for Belichick.

   “The evidence may go in a way where the Commonwealth challenges that he
   was known to be a thug in the locker room, that he was known to be a
   bad guy,” said Manion. “They may bring Belichick out and say, have you
   heard any of that? I’m doubting the Commonwealth would do that,
   though.”

   Earlier in the month, a defense motion said Patriots offensive
   coordinator [151]Josh McDaniels may testify on the possible meanings of
   some of Hernandez’s tattoos.

   WBZ-TV Sports Director Steve Burton is also listed as a potential
   witness in the court paperwork. The documents cite Steve’s 2011
   interview with Hernandez.

   Hernandez is about to go on trial for the a double murder in Boston’s
   South End in July of 2012. Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado were both
   gunned down in a drive-by shooting.

   Prosecutors contend Hernandez told a friend that one of the victims was
   “trying” or challenging him during an encounter at a nightclub.

   They want to submit a jailhouse cellphone conversation where he tells a
   former college teammate he plans to get another tattoo in the shape of
   a stop sign that will send the message, “beware, no hesitations  Feel
   me, like no try me there’s no hesitations.”

   In another call, prosecutors say Hernandez tells his mother she cannot
   be trusted with information.

   Manion believes the calls “are a reach,” but prosecutors hope it helps
   get to motive in the case, a case Manion sees as a tough one for the
   defense.

   “What’s the defense, somebody else did it?” Manion said.

   According to the documents, the defense also plans to call experts to
   testify about marijuana use in the NFL, and the correlation between
   marijuana and violence.

   Jury selection continues with the trial set to start March 1.

   Hernandez is already serving a life sentence without parole for the
   2013 murder of Odin Lloyd.
