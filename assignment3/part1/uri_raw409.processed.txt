   Post Falls, ID. February 2, 2017 – [38]www.anterisalliance.com Anteris
   Alliance, LLC was founded in early 2017, based on the concept of
   companies working together to do more than they could accomplish by
   themselves from demonstrations, events, sales and ultimately Veterans
   and First Responder support. Already, with over 32 brands and counting,
   the mission has taken hold at every level. Whether as a manufacturer or
   service provider, a buyer, or a patriot there is a way for everyone to
   be part of this great mission!

   PatriotList.US is a closed loop safe and secure version of Craigslist
   for the Military, Veteran, and Government communities that verifies the
   identity of each user and utilizes trusted peer to peer payment systems
   for added safety. When we found out that a consortium of veteran and
   first responder supporting companies was being brought together to
   leverage expertise and marketing networks to benefit the active duty,
   veteran, and first responder community we knew it would be a perfect
   match with our mission as a company.

   Patriot List pledges to provide a mobile first market platform for
   members of the Alliance to sell their retail products directly to
   members of the military and veteran communities. The Patriot List
   unique mobile application and website provides “Trust” and “Reputation”
   to a unique closed loop P2P marketplace that is required for our
   Veteran and Active duty communities to stay safe when buying and
   selling online.

   “Technological and social innovation are evolutionary processes that
   are central to economic growth and change. An alliance of companies
   that share similar values working together to serve a market segment
   that shares those same values is a recipe for success.” Colin Supko
   (Founder PatriotList.US)

   “It has been amazing to see young companies with amazing new concepts
   for service a target audience come into the market! Patriot List, being
   Veteran owned, and dedicated to generating a safe place for every day
   commerce peer to peer, is definitely on the cutting edge of business
   function, and like the Alliance are leaning forward to provide smarter
   business models. We could not be more excited to have them on board
   with the Anteris Alliance,” – stated Casey Betzold, CEO of Anteris
   Alliance.
