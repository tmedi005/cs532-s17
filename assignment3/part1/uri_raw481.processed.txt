   Students at Dinwiddie High School in Virginia were ordered on Monday to
   remove American flags flying from their truck beds.

   Daniel Nunnally, Jr., told television station WRIC he was pulled out of
   class and told to remove not only Old Glory but also the Gadsden flag.

   "I kind of started getting angry because what's the problem with the
   American flag," Daniel told the television station.

   Daniel is not the kind of kid to cause trouble, so he did as he was
   ordered to do -- and retired the Stars & Stripes.

   Word spread after reporter Parker Slaybaugh posted the story on his
   Facebook page and the following day more than a dozen students showed
   up to class with the Star-Spangled Banner proudly flying on their
   vehicles.
