   In a night filled with [48]partisan politics, [49]emotional journeys
   and [50]bad jokes, the most personal appeal to a key American
   constituency aired after the Big Game, when Hyundai and its agency of
   record Innocean Worldwide Americas connected active members of the U.S.
   military with loved ones half a world away.

   The most impressive aspect of “A Better Super Bowl” is that it was all
   filmed during the game at both Houston’s NRG Stadium and a military
   base in Zagan, Poland, then aired immediately after the Patriots came
   back to win the first Super Bowl to need overtime.

   The 90-second spot is only the first stage in an ongoing campaign
   called “Better Drives Us.” And it wouldn’t have happened without the
   help of the NFL, Fox Sports, the Department of Defense and a team of
   sleep-deprived strategists, creatives and planners on the media and
   client sides. (A late, game-tying touchdown by Tom Brady and company
   didn’t hurt, either.)

   Here’s how it went down.

   “We have been embracing the military for years,” said Hyundai North
   America chief marketing officer Dean Evans. “There are a few
   organizations we support, and we’ve been dedicated to incentive
   programs for active members and with local dealers located around
   military bases.”

   These initiatives scored Hyundai a spot on two annual lists of
   America’s top military employers in 2017. “It’s a longstanding
   relationship,” said Eric Springer, chief creative officer at agency of
   record Innocean, adding, “It’s organic to the soul of the company, so
   this wasn’t a stunt whatsoever.”

   The planning phase started months ago with one big idea: to surprise
   U.S. troops stationed abroad on Super Bowl Sunday with virtual visits
   from their family members in the states.

   “[Hyundai] threw a huge party at a base in Poland,” said Springer in
   summing up the campaign. “These troops are over there so the rest of us
   can sit around and eat as many buffalo wings as we like on a gluttonous
   day in America.”

   After Innocean got Hyundai on board, Evans pitched the idea to the NFL
   over the phone. “The best moments of the Super Bowl won’t happen on the
   field,” he said—and while both the league and Fox Sports weren’t
   initially sure what to make of such a huge project, all parties quickly
   got on board. Springer said, “The Department of Defense really loved
   the idea and kept asking, Can we bring a few more troops in?”

   The Innocean/Hyundai team effectively split, with one half in Poland
   and the other in Houston along with director Peter Berg of “Friday
   Night Lights” fame. They chose three service members and flew their
   families to Houston the week before the Super Bowl; it was a larger
   undertaking than one might think given the U.S. military’s
   classification system, but the team made it work.

   In Poland, Hyundai set up an immersive tent (created by Igloo) in which
   the selected service members could watch the game in 360 degrees,
   unaware that they would soon be surprised by their loved ones. “It was
   a huge reversal,” said Springer of the campaign’s key innovation.
   “We’ve all seen spots where the troops surprise the family, but this
   time the family surprised the troops.”

   While this was going on, the teams were simultaneously shooting in both
   locations during the first quarter of the game, the Innocean team
   embedded with the NFL Films crew in Houston. “Everything you have to do
   in three months for a normal ad we did in about 48 minutes,” Springer
   said. Most of the second quarter involved editing that footage in a
   trailer outside the stadium in Houston. “We had to be very decisive,
   which agencies aren’t generally known for,” Springer said, “and by
   halftime we had a cut. Then a Fox Sports guy, an NFL guy and two
   Department of Defense people sat in the trailer, watched it and said,
   ‘We love it.'”

   After delivering the final work to Fox during the third quarter, the
   team finally had a moment to breathe, head up to the suite and take in
   the last minutes of the game along with the military families and
   Hyundai executives.

   That was when Brady and his team took things into overtime. “You can’t
   buy that kind of timing,” Springer said, and Evans described the end of
   Sunday’s game as a case of “everything coming together at once, thank
   God!”

   Viewers may note that this work, unlike every other auto ad that ran
   last night, did not include any product shots or related footage. “It
   was a huge act of ‘better’ on Hyundai’s part,” said Springer. “You
   don’t always have to show a car to sell a car; you have to show a
   better car company.”
