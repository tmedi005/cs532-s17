   With five sparkling Vince Lombardi Trophies in their grasp, a
   contingent of the Super Bowl Champion New England Patriots took the
   stage at the Dunkin’ Donuts Center Tuesday afternoon, adding a
   Providence stop to the victory parade that had already brought the team
   through Boston.

   A crowd of Rhode Islanders, some of them nearly swooning, erupted in
   wild adulation as the champs took the stage, accompanied by Patriots
   owner Robert Kraft.

   Garbed in their blue home jerseys and thrusting Lombardi Trophies
   skyward were Trey Flowers, Rob Ninkovich, Joe Thuney, James Develin and
   David Andrews.

   Kraft took the microphone, talked about Rhode Island’s importance as a
   fan base, threw in a little history and then got to an important topic.

   GOATs. That’s an acronym for Greatest of All Time.

   “We know we have the GOAT of the players in our quarterback Tom Brady,”
   said Kraft. “And we know we have the GOAT of coaches in Bill Belichick,
   but what our team understands is that we have a GOAT of tight ends.”

   At that, a sixth Patriot, an injured tight end but healthy showman, Rob
   Gronkowski, made his entrance to the gathering to wild cheers, proudly
   wearing his No. 87 jersey. Then, to even more cheers, he took a shot at
   holding all five of the Patriots’ Lombardi Trophies at once, stopping
   at four after nearly fumbling one.

   “I thought Boston was crazy today,” said Gronkowski, who thrilled fans
   when he took off his jersey and tossed it into the crowd. “Providence
   is just as crazy, baby!”

   Gronkowski, who was not able to play in the Super Bowl, praised each of
   his teammates on the stage, including a certain defensive lineman who
   was in on three sacks of Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan on
   Sunday.

   “We gave Matt Ryan a present, and it was Trey Flowers,” Gronkowski
   quipped.

   Patriots fullback James Develin, a Brown alum, noticed a group of young
   men in Brown football jerseys.

   “I’ve got to hand it over to my guys over here,” Develin said.

   “I still live in Rhode Island,” he added. “I love our Rhode Island
   fans. It’s an honor to play for you guys. Thank you so much for coming
   here and thank you so much for your support. ... We love you,
   Lombardi.”

   Said center David Andrews: “Thank you all for the support. The best
   fans in the nation. We couldn’t have done it without you.”

   The crowd, which had taken about half of the arena’s seats and occupied
   about 80 percent of the standing area on the floor, had waited
   patiently, and with class, for the players and the gleaming trophies,
   which are made in Rhode Island.

   Lyndsey Deane, 23, of Johnston, and 28-year-old Lisa Vongratsavay, of
   Providence, found floor space near a media area and relived Sunday’s
   championship with the rest of the crowd as replays from the Patriots’
   come-from-behind victory played on a video scoreboard.

   The Patriots overcame a 25-point deficit to beat the Atlanta Falcons,
   34-28, in the first-ever overtime game in Super Bowl history.

   Nearby, 5-year-old Samayah Silva and 10-year-old Yovannie Perez, waited
   with their mother Vanessa Tapia, who had plucked them out of school.

   “It’s a once-in-a-lifetime thing,” said Tapia, of East Providence, a
   certified nursing assistant. “... Especially at their age, they will
   remember it forever.”

   The event was the product of some texts that Gov. Gina Raimondo sent to
   Patriots President Jonathan Kraft on Monday morning. Raimondo and Kraft
   are friends, said Raimondo spokesman David Ortiz.

   State officials had initially suggested holding the rally at the Rhode
   Island Convention Center, but it wasn’t available.

   Dunkin' Donuts, the company, was expected to bear the costs of the
   rally, according to the governor's office.

   As part of its naming-rights deal, the coffee-and-doughnut chain has
   rights for $50,000 worth of special events at the arena. The company
   decided on short notice to apply that toward the Patriots rally.

   Calling in staff and putting a floor down over the ice costs around
   $3,000, Dunkin' Donuts Center general manager Larry Lepore said.

   Meanwhile, Providence police and the Rhode Island State Police
   contributed some officers and troopers, who were already on duty to
   watch the event, Lepore said. The Providence police said they added a
   sergeant, four patrol officers and two officers on bicycles on
   city-paid overtime to work the celebration.
