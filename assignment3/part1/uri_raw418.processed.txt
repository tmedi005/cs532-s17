   Is the NFL going to punish anyone not named Tom Brady or Robert Kraft
   to the letter of the law? How much more corrupt can the National
   Football League possibly look with the slaps on the wrists it has doled
   out to [20]the Steelers for deflating footballs (sound familiar?!?) and
   the Giants (using walkie talkies on the sideline). Oh wait…..

   Yes, the NFL is “generally aware” that they are completely SCREWING the
   Patriots with each misdemeanor punishment they continue to hand out for
   each football felony.
   [INS: :INS]

   Next contestants on the “NFL won’t punish you unless you are a dynasty
   they want to UNJUSTLY TEAR DOWN“…

   Say Hello and how do you do to the Seattle Seahawks and the New York
   Football Jets!

   Contestant #1 – the Seattle Seahawks who INTENTIONALLY LIED about
   cornerback Richard Sherman’s injury…..

   [21]USA TODAY

   After the regular season ended, Seahawks coach Pete Carroll revealed
   that Sherman had been dealing with a medial collateral ligament injury,
   but it wasn’t listed on any of the team’s injury reports.

   ESPN reported last month that the Seahawks were in jeopardy of being
   [22]stripped of a second-round draft pick.

   “I’m feeling like I screwed that up with not telling you that,” Carroll
   said in a January news conference. “He was OK, so I don’t know. He
   never missed anything, I guess, is probably why.”

   Ok, wait a minute…so Head Coach Pete Carroll ADMITS he broke the rules
   and all they get is a “don’t do that again bad little boy”. How does it
   get leaked that the Seahawks could lose a second round pick to then it
   becomes NOTHING? The reason is that they are NOT The New England
   Patriots plus they lost a Super Bowl to the “Evil Empire” because Petey
   is a F’N MORON just ask Marshawn.

   Contestant #2 – The New York Jets who executed an underhanded,
   deceitful and COMPLETELY ILLEGAL tampering scheme involving then
   Patriots cornerback Darrelle Revis only handing out a “jaywalking
   level” fine of $100,000. This is before the [23]NY Daily News uncovered
   the NY Jets special covert op:

   Team officials in stealth mode communicated with Revis, Inc., through
   private cell phones and face-to-face covert meetings at the 2015
   Scouting Combine rather than make calls from the team’s landlines at
   their Florham Park facility. No paper trails were a must.

   Johnson, the driving force behind bringing back Revis to right a wrong
   in his mind, endorsed all of it.

   Well, holy sweet F*CK! Are you kidding me Goodell?

   You proved the Jets’ owner Woody Johnson was guilty with his stupid ass
   comments and the Patriots GOT NOTHING?!?!

   Hey CROOKED Roger! Your Move!

   Was this a scheme? Yep.

   Does it compromise the integrity of the game? Double Yep.

   Will anything come of this? NOPE.

   Because the NFL is an ABSOLUTE & UTTER J-O-K-E (see the witch hunt
   known as Deflategate)!

   They are the true definition of a HYPOCRISY:

   The practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which
   one’s own behavior does not conform; pretense.

   Well I hope the NFL knows the definition of this word because the
   Patriots sure do…..

   KARMA…..and it’s A BITCH!
