Patriots 2015 Offensive Snap Usage: How Martellus Bennett Changes the Game

   [48]New, [49]9 comments

   Earlier in the offseason we took a look at [56]the New England Patriots
   personnel usage on defense. We found that the [57]Patriots used just
   two linebackers 75% of the time, that the secondary featured five or
   more players on 83.5% of snaps, and that the defense was far better
   with defensive tackle [58]Malcom Brown on the field.

   We're going to turn our focus to the offensive side of the ball and the
   biggest change this offseason has to be the addition of tight end
   [59]Martellus Bennett from the [60]Chicago Bears. Bennett is one of the
   most dynamic receiving tight ends in the league, but he's also an above
   average blocker.

   Bennett joins All Pro tight end [61]Rob Gronkowski to give the Patriots
   the best tight end duo, [62]probably in the history of the sport. The
   2011 Patriots with Gronkowski and [63]Aaron Hernandez remain the only
   season in NFL history where one team featured two 900+ yard tight
   ends, [64]and we can check the tape to see how Bennett could be
   deployed as a receiver.

   But where Bennett could help the Patriots the most is just in his
   presence.

   Last season, the Patriots paired Gronkowski with the likes of [65]Scott
   Chandler and Michael Williams. Chandler was a weak blocker, so teams
   new that the Patriots were going to pass the ball. Williams was such a
   non-threat as a receiver that [66]teams would decide not to even cover
   him, and he acted as an effective 6th offensive lineman on the field.

   When Williams was the only tight end on the field, the Patriots ran the
   ball 70% of the time, versus 79% passing plays when any other tight end
   was the only one on the field. When Williams was paired with another
   tight end, the Patriots ran 52% of the time; the Patriots passed the
   ball 72% of the time out of two tight end sets without Williams on the
   field.

   In other words, the presence of Williams generally telegraphed that a
   rushing play was more likely on its way.

   On the other side, when Chandler was the only tight end on the field,
   the Patriots passed 88% of the time, which is a 58% greater chance of
   passing the ball than with Williams on the field.

   The Patriots, in general, are going to pass the ball on roughly 60% of
   snaps, so using Chandler or Williams as the second tight end on the
   field telegraphs pass or run nearly as much as when the Patriots put
   [67]Dion Lewis or [68]LeGarrette Blount in the backfield (the Patriots
   passed on 78% of plays with Lewis, and ran on 63% of plays with
   Blount).

   The same desire for a tight end that can block and catch is mirrored
   in [69]the team's possible desire in drafting a running back that is a
   better receiver than Blount. Bennett might not be a 6th offensive
   tackle, like Williams, but at least he will force opposing defenses to
   guess the Patriots play. The New England is always at its most
   dangerous when it can change from running the ball to passing, all
   while keeping the same personnel on the field.
