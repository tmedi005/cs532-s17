Recent Patriots rumors are about what will happen with quarterback Jimmy
Garoppolo. A recent report says a blockbuster offer could be coming.

   One of the biggest Patriots rumors so far this offseason has been what
   will happen with quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo.

   Due to his brief success filling in for Tom Brady in the first two
   games of the seasons, teams like what they see. Garoppolo played very
   well against the Arizona Cardinals and the Miami Dolphins, and some
   believe he can be a franchise quarterback.

   In the NFL, finding a franchise quarterback is one of the most
   difficult things to accomplish. With that being said, a franchise
   quarterback is also worth a lot.

   [31]According to Mike Freeman of Bleacher Report, a big offer might be
   coming the Patriots’ way soon for Garoppolo. [32]Here’s what Freeman
   had to say.

     Yet there are some truth-tellers who never lie (at least I don’t
     think they do). What those executives are telling me—three of them,
     two from the NFC—is they believe some team is going to make the New
     England Patriots an offer for Jimmy Garoppolo they cannot refuse.

     I want to be clear about what I’m being told: They believe several
     teams are preparing to make blockbuster offers for Garoppolo. I’m
     not saying it will happen. I’m saying this is the belief of some
     around football. They think a draft shakeup is coming and that it
     will involve Garoppolo.

   With the NFL Draft still a few months away, it could be the Patriots
   that make a big impact. It is widely believed that Garoppolo is worth
   at least a first round pick. Now, it’s just a question of how high a
   team might be willing to go.

   As of now, the San Francisco 49ers and Chicago Bears are both in need
   of a quarterback. Those two teams are drafting second and third in the
   first round. For the Patriots either of those picks would be appealing.

   Also, the Cleveland Browns have two picks in the first round. They also
   have a need for a quarterback, and they certainly have the assets to
   get a deal done.

   With free agency starting soon, it will be interesting to see if a team
   gives the Patriots an amazing offer that they can’t say no to. As of
   now, the Patriots are drafting 32^nd in the 2017 NFL Draft. However,
   trading Garoppolo will likely result in them having another much higher
   pick in the first round.
