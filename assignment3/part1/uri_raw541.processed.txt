Mike Freeman's 10-Point Stance: Patriots' Big Trade Bait, NFL's Athletic
Freaks

   Football, lies and videotape...


   1. Jimmy Garoppolo and the Dak Prescott Phenomenon

   Remember one thing about the combine and [29]NFL draft: Around this
   time, almost everyone in football lies.

   All the time. Every second. Lie upon lie upon lie. Teams do it as a
   sort of misinformation campaign, hoping some sucker club falls for a
   lie. So as you read information about the combine and draft, remember
   this fact.

   Yet there are some truth-tellers who never lie (at least I don't think
   they do). What those executives are telling me‚Äîthree of them, two from
   the NFC‚Äîis they believe some team is going to make the [30]New England
   Patriots an offer for Jimmy Garoppolo they cannot refuse.

   I want to be clear about what I'm being told: They believe several
   teams are preparing to make blockbuster offers for Garoppolo. I'm not
   saying it will happen. I'm saying this is the belief of some around
   football. They think a draft shakeup is coming and that it will involve
   Garoppolo.

   The increasingly popular view among some in the league is that
   Garoppolo can transform a franchise almost overnight and is worth a
   first-round pick.

   There's a desperation that's sweeping the league when it comes to
   finding a quarterback, greater than I've seen in a long time. One
   front-office executive called it the Dak Prescott Phenomenon.

   Prescott was a big reason the [31]Cowboys transformed their franchise,
   and some people in football think Garoppolo can do the same. This is a
   massive assumption, but, again, teams may think it's worth the risk and
   the high price it would take.

   There's evidence Garoppolo could be effective. He completed 71.2
   percent of his passes in two games against Arizona and [32]Miami. He
   threw for 496 yards and four scores combined.

   The Patriots have become the best franchise in football, and one reason
   is the way they have accumulated draft picks and then drafted smartly.
   They have been far from perfect, but pretty good. Trading Garoppolo
   would fit into what the Patriots have done under [33]Bill Belichick.

   Yes, everyone lies.

   But I do think the Garoppolo talk is heating up, and I'm not sure it's
   going away soon.


   2. How Long Will Bill Belichick Coach?

   PEBBLE BEACH, CA - FEBRUARY 09: Bill Belichick hits his tee shot on the
   3rd hole during Round One of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am at Monterey

   We're spending a lot of time focusing on Garoppolo, but what is
   Belichick's future with the Patriots?

   Every indication I hear from inside the Patriots is that Belichick
   plans to stay on as coach of the team for at least five more years.

   These people also say Belichick wants to coach after Brady retires.
   They think Belichick wants to prove he can win without the best
   quarterback of all time.


   3. A Young [34]Randy Moss

   We know how good Randy Moss was. He's a Hall of Famer.

   What's often lost is how good he could have been at basketball. He was
   a star in high school, and had he decided to play beyond that, who
   knows how good he could have been?

   I saw the above video on Twitter, and it reminded me of what could have
   been for Moss. That's it. That's all. I like dreaming of [36]alternate
   universes.


   4. Jen Welter in the News

   Arizona Cardinals on the field during the team training camp at

   When Jen Welter took an assistant position with the [37]Arizona
   Cardinals in the 2015 preseason, she became the first female assistant
   in NFL history.

   Gridiron Australia [38]just announced Welter will lead the Australian
   Outback Women's National Team (that's a mouthful). She will lead Team
   Australia at the 2017 IFAF Women's World Championship (another
   mouthful).

   The question now becomes: Will Welter coach in the NFL again?


   5. Jack Del Rio Gets Understandably Nervous

   [39]A photo posted by Kelechi Osemele (@k.o.seven0)


   First, you have to marvel at 330-pound [40]Raiders offensive lineman
   Kelechi Osemele doing a backflip off what he said was "the highest
   swing in the world." The fact a dude that big can do something that
   athletic is amazing.

   He also went whitewater rafting in New Zealand. I love this dude (NSFW
   video).

   So does Raiders coach Jack Del Rio, and why not. Osemele is a Pro
   Bowler and was a big reason why the Raiders were a surprise team last
   season.

   Del Rio saw the video and, safe to say, almost pooped himself.

   Coaches have always worried about players in the offseason. The main
   concern is always staying out of trouble with the law. The secondary
   concern is always players doing wild stuff like whitewater rafting.

   Many contracts prevent guys from skydiving and similar acts. In
   general, teams want their players to go to the gym, then go home and
   watch a Star Trek marathon on Netflix.

   But these are NFL players. They thrive on challenge and adrenaline.
   They can't just shut it off because the season is over. They need that
   rush, and this is one way some guys will try to get it.


   6. Does Ezekiel Elliott Run Like [43]Adrian Peterson?

   ARLINGTON, TX - JANUARY 15: Ezekiel Elliott #21 of the Dallas Cowboys

   Packers in the NFC Divisional Playoff game at AT&T Stadium on January
   15, 2017 in Arlington, Texas. (Photo by Tom Penn
   Tom Pennington/Getty Images

   I always thought something about Elliott's running style was familiar,
   but I could never quite place it. Then I read a story by [44]Jesse
   Borek on FanRag Sports about a [45]Cowboys sports radio
   show with Dallas Morning News reporters Brandon George and Jon Machota
   in which they discuss how Elliott can improve dramatically as a runner
   and receiver from where he is now. Which is scary.

   The part that intrigued me most was an interview with former NFL QB Gus
   Frerotte in which Frerotte compares Elliott's running style to Adrian
   Peterson's. (Frerotte was Elliott's high school coach, and he was a
   teammate of Peterson's.)

   What made Peterson so good was his patience in finding an opening, then
   exploding through it at warp speed. There are maybe two or three backs
   today who can do that at a Pro Bowl level (Le'Veon Bell is one of
   them). Elliott is another.

   This is why the Cowboys will be a massive threat next year and beyond.
   Elliott's style of running fits perfectly with how that line blocks.
   Combine that with how the offense also has a legitimate passing game,
   and this is why teams have expressed fear of how Dallas could be a
   dynasty for the next decade.


   7. Alabama Tight End O.J. Howard Is a Freak

   This video doesn't mean O.J. Howard is going to be a good player. It
   just means what he's doing is freaking incredible. That's all. That's
   it.

   Go try it. I did with a 25-pound weight and almost broke a hip.


   8. A Troubled Life Continues

   INDIANAOPLIS, IN - OCTOBER 7: Cedric Benson #32 of the Green Bay

   the Indianapolis Colts at Lucas Oil Stadium on October 7, 2012 in
   Indianapolis, Indiana. The Colts defeated the Packers 3

   I knew Cedric Benson, the former Texas and NFL running back. Not well,
   but I interviewed him several times. Through the years, he's been
   involved in various legal entanglements. Now, he's been accused of
   [47]driving while intoxicated.

   Benson is another example of how some players‚Äîand it's not a small
   number‚Äîhave found it challenging adjusting to post-NFL life. There's no
   need to get into other names who've had troubles, but this has been an
   issue for some time.

   The NFL has programs in place to help players deal with life after
   football, but it seems they are proving only partially effective.


   9. Deshaun Watson Might Be Combine Star

   SACRAMENTO, CA - FEBRUARY 8: Deshaun Watson of the Clemson Tigers

   February 8, 2017 at Golden 1 Center in Sacramento, California. NOTE TO
   USER: User expressly acknowledges and agrees that,
   Rocky Widner/Getty Images

   And that isn't meant as a backhanded compliment.

   [48]Stephen Hawkins of the Associated Press reports Watson will do
   everything at the combine, including running and throwing. I know
   scouts who believe Watson will have one of the best combine
   performances of any quarterback in recent years. We'll see.

   The fact (so far at least) that Watson plans on doing everything at the
   combine, when many star quarterbacks skip significant parts of it, will
   make a lot of teams happy.


   10. Could DeSean Jackson Sign with Patriots?

   PHILADELPHIA - AUGUST 13: Quarterback Tom Brady #12 of the New England

   Philadelphia Eagles on August 13, 2009 at Lincoln Financial Field in
   Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Hunter Mar
   Hunter Martin/Getty Images

   One scout believes Jackson will end up in either New England or Dallas,
   with the Patriots being the more likely choice.

   This is just the scout's belief. The Patriots keep secrets better than
   the CIA, so no one really knows, but it could work. Belichick took a
   gamble on veteran receiving threats like Randy Moss and Chad Ochocinco
   in the past.

   My guess: He ends up in [49]Jacksonville.
