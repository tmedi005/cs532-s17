   As seen on [37]Tucker Carlson Tonight

   On "Tucker Carlson Tonight," Ann Coulter gave President Trump an
   overall "A+" grade for his governance after his first month in office.

   She said Trump earned a solid "A" right off the bat because of the fact
   he replaced former President Barack Obama, and that he's been even more
   impressive considering the opposition he's faced.

   "We've never had a president who's being opposed on all fronts like
   this," Coulter said.

   "Considering all that he has to do, he's Gary Cooper out there in 'High
   Noon,'" she added, referencing the 1952 Western. "He is standing there
   alone, and he has done so much in the first month considering that."

   Him'
     __________________________________________________________________

   Coulter said she particularly likes Trump's confrontational approach to
   the press and "fake news" stories, and she sees promise in some of his
   cabinet picks.

   "One of the reasons Trump is getting an A+ is Jeff Sessions at
   Department of Justice," she said, adding that she is confident Sessions
   will halt the alleged habit of the federal government hiding immigrant
   crime statistics.

   "The government hides this information," she said, alleging that the
   contention that immigrants commit crimes at a lesser rate than
   natural-born citizens is a trope based on a false equivalency.

   Coulter said she would advise Trump to take a closer look at legal
   immigrants as much as he has done to illegal immigrants, noting the
   Boston bombers and San Bernardino terrorists came to America legally.

   She said she only has one complaint about Trump one month in: "He
   should tweet more."

   Watch more from Coulter above, and see Mike Huckabee explain why he
   thinks opposition to Trump's immigration policies is [47]"manufactured
   outrage."
