Islamic State Vows More Attacks

(AP) CAIRO — An Islamic State group affiliate in Egypt released a video
Monday showing the suicide bomber who killed nearly 30 people when he
attacked a packed church in December and vowing more attacks on the country’s
Christian.

   A narrator says in the 20-minute video that the Egyptian Christians are
   the extremist group’s “favorite prey.”
    The video shows footage of Egypt’s Coptic Christian pope, Christian
   businessmen, judges and priests who either speak of the need to protect
   the minority or use derogatory terms to refer to Egypt’s Muslim
   majority. The narrator says Christians were no longer “dhimmis,” a
   reference to non-Muslims in Islam who enjoy a degree of state
   protection. Instead, the group describes the Christians as “infidels”
   who are empowering the West against Muslim nations.

   “God gave orders to kill every infidel,” one of the militants carrying
   an AK-47 assault rifle says in the video.

   Egypt’s Coptic Christians, who make up around 10 percent of the
   population, have been always a favorite target of Islamic extremists.
   Attacks on churches by Muslim mobs increased since the 2013 military
   overthrow of an Islamist president. Christians overwhelmingly supported
   the army chief-turned-president, Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, and extremists
   have used such support as a pretext to increase attacks against them.
    The video shows footage of Abu Abdullah al-Masri, the militant who
   blew himself up at the central Cairo church last month. The attack,
   says the narrator, was “only the beginning.”

   “Oh worshipprs of the cross … the soldiers of the state are watching
   you,” another masked militant identified as Abu Zubair al-Masri says.

   The video carries the logo “Egypt” instead of the normal “Wilayat
   Sinai” or the state of Sinai. Wilayat Sinai, the name of the IS branch
   in Sinai, has claimed responsibility for dozens of suicide bombings and
   attacks, mainly targeting security forces and military across the
   country but primarily in Sinai Peninsula, where the army has been
   leading an anti-terrorism operation for years.

   The IS message comes at a time when attacks on Coptic Christians have
   escalated in Sinai. In the past month, at least three Christians were
   gunned down in separate drive-by shooting attacks in the city of
   el-Arish.

       More proof over “the religion of peace” in its true colors-murder
       thy fellow man,who is an infidel and a Christian! another fine
       example of crazed Islamic/Muslims who have no problem showing what
       they’re all about,,violence and killings,fine examples of their
       twisted religious beliefs-something that President Trump is trying
       to keep out of this country,,but that’s right! he’s now an
       intolerant bigot,and thanks to our misguided liberal left and the
       liberal media,keeping out these terrorist vermin has now become
       that much more tougher! but we have the federal court of appeals to
       thank for this,and we have some of Obama’s leftover people to also
       give this example to!

       ISIS needs to be exterminated. “Mad Dog” Mattis needs to send A-10
       Warthogs and B-52s to carpet bomb their road convoys. In western
       countries, we need to employ more snipers and civilians need to
       learn sniper skills to protect their own communities. European
       leaders need to wake up and stop denying the atrocities committed
       by barbaric infiltrators. Kill them or deport them.
