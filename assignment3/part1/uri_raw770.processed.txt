Guardlab’s 3D Printed Mouth Guards Are Changing the Way the UFC Fights

   Aidan Butler has taken teeth, yes teeth, and made them interesting
   thanks to a few 3D printing machines and some seriously famous
   athletes.

   “Hey, I’m English. What do I know about teeth?” So says Aidan Butler,
   CEO of Guardlab, Inc, who runs a company that makes a product that
   protects your teeth. Actually, Butler knows A LOT about teeth, and
   through his partnership with a couple of enterprising dentists, he has
   become almost uncannily well-versed on pearly whites, jaws, and even
   the way you breath. As we walk around the Guardlab headquarters in
   Farmingdale, NY (45 minutes east of the city), he pauses at a computer
   station to pull up a floating three-dimensional scan of some anonymous
   person’s chompers—theyʼre...not great. Nevertheless, I can see them in
   great detail, from the gums to pointy incisors. Soon this scan will
   manifest as a hard plastic reproduction of the real thing thanks to one
   of their 3D printers. Elsewhere, a technician will use a machine to
   melt some proprietary goopy plasticky type stuff (science) over the
   faux set and voila: a neuromuscular guard, designed to keep ones jaw on
   tight when one gets smacked, hard. Just the kind of thing that happens
   when, say, [7]Conor McGregor gets you in the ring.

   Turns out that Guardlab is the official mouth guard of the UFC—not a
   small feat considering MMA is the one sport where you are required to
   punch and kick people in the face, and the fact that the custom guard
   industry is rife with competition. But the burgeoning popularity of the
   UFC in the United States made it a particularly choice target for a
   company like Guardlab which claims to manufacture a better, safer
   customized mouth guard in the least annoying way (no putty molds, no
   giant payout). MMA and the UFC were Guardlabʼs holy grail of "official
   mouthguard"-ships. “What’s the toughest fucking sport known to man,"
   asks Butler, rhetorically. "MMA. Look, if we’re going to get validation
   for the best goddamn mouth guards in the world, we have to get these
   guys." And Butler got in with them almost by accident when he met
   fighter Joe Lauzon while paint-balling (of all things). The two men hit
   it off, Butler made a sales pitch, and Lauzon picked up what he was
   putting down. “The first time we were in a fight, I was so nervous," he
   said. "What if this guy gets hit and it doesn’t work? But, long story
   short, [Lauzon] loved it, and I got introduced to the UFC.” After that,
   Guardlab had to run the UFC health and safety gauntlet, presenting
   their doctors and professionals with evidence that Guardlab guards were
   really the most effective way to keep your teeth in your head. "It was
   a big process to go through," says Butler "but now they feel
   comfortable that all of their fighters have access to the best mouth
   guards." To date, theyʼve scanned 150 of the fighters, and have found
   theyʼre just as into the guards as the UFC. "We don’t pay people to
   wear our products and don’t try to outbid other companies. We’ve found
   athletes generally come around to wanting one of ours."

   Itʼs worth mentioning that Guardlab is a young company—really young. It
   was founded in 2014 but went live in 2015 making them just about 2 or 3
   years old depending on how you look at it. In that time, theyʼve not
   only become the official mouth guard of the most brutal sport on earth,
   but they provide mouth guards to the New England Patriots, The White
   Sox, The Blue Jays, Georgetown University, the Australian Football
   League, the whole of the Renzo Gracie Academy, and more. Normal folks
   can get the mouth guards too through the extensive network of dentists
   or their "[8]Find a 3D Scanner" tool on their website. Butler calls
   particular attention to a smaller "guard" that fits on your lower teeth
   and doesnʼt so much protect as keep your face in check. This one helps
   athletes in any sport keep their jaws and bites aligned, especially
   when they grit during exertion. The alignment promotes better posture
   and airflow which is why Guardlab can count Olympic rowers and speed
   skaters—remember Apollo Ohno?—as customers too. Butler thinks everyone
   should have at least one, and keeps trying to convince me that even
   though I donʼt fight, or even work out really (¯_(ツ)_/¯) I should
   probably get fit for a guard right there and then. "People donʼt
   realize how delicate all this is," (he motions to his waggling jaw).
   "Alignment is so important for keeping yourself awake, not getting
   knocked out, and not getting injured."

   Butler, who just turned 40, originally hails from Birmingham, England,
   aka that city where Peaky Blinders takes place. When I bring up this
   pop culture connection he says something along the lines of “Oh yeah,
   that show is about my family.” Turns out Butler himself was a licensed
   bookmaker in Birmingham, just like his father before him, and his
   father’s father before him. But after a few career twists he found
   himself in a room with two dentists and their design for a better mouth
   guard, one that not only protected your top row of teeth but kept your
   whole jaw inline when it took an impact. Custom medical guards are not
   a new concept—in fact 3D scanning and 3D printing is a bit of a trend
   in the dental industry—but the idea of using this technology for sports
   guards primarily was something Butler brought to the table and
   ultimately ignited his passion for the project. “Could somebody do a
   real disruption on garden shovels? Yeah! But do I want to? No!" (For
   the record, Butler then presented—off the cuff—about 5 genius garden
   shovel improvements.) Ultimately it was the aforementioned interest in
   sports, and probably the fact that heʼs by birth a betting man, that
   inspired him to take on teeth. “It was a better product, but it needed
   a better way to get to market.”

   So the former bookie and self-proclaimed tech-nerd came up with the
   idea of incorporating scans, a 3-D printer, and that goopy plasticky
   mold (at right) into sports guard manufacturing. At first it was his
   ambition to become the "Uber of mouth guards," imagining hundreds of
   travelling scanners on demand for whomever requested one. "It was a
   Great Idea! But how much are the scanners," he says with a laugh. "50
   grand!" That was obviously financially unviable, so he turned to plan
   B: dentists. Guardlab formed relationships with hundreds of dentists
   who were already using the scanners and then convinced them that their
   guard design was the best. And thanks to their proprietary process,
   getting a perfectly fitted guard, whether medical or sport-related, is
   vastly more cost efficient. Before, medical guards could cost over
   $1200 each time, and if your bite changed thanks to a crown or a lost
   tooth? Too bad, do it all again. Now theyʼre relatively cheap: around
   $150 for kids, $250 for adults. Sport guards, while more expensive that
   the traditional boil-and-bites (you know, the ones you used in high
   school), are still a pretty good deal—two customized guards for $99.

   Now that they’ve conquered, or rather saved, teeth whatʼs next for the
   enterprising former-bookie? Shins. Yes, shins—as in shin guards. Butler
   wants to scan your shins and used the same customizing technology he
   uses for your mouth, to create perfect-fitting guards for your legs.
   But then, talking to Butler, one gets the sense that this train has
   really just left the station, thereʼs so much more of our soft,
   fallible bodies that could be sheathed in protective gear. After all,
   remember that this is the man who had only a casual relationship with
   his own teeth and admits: “Nobody told me what floss was until I was
   27.” If he can turn that into a burgeoning dental empire, I think we
   can expect more big, disrupting, 3D printed things from him yet.
