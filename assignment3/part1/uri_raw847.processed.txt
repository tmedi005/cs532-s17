REPORT: Patriots Star Expected to Leave Team in Free Agency

   [8]Adrian Wilson22 Feb 2017

   Hey, it was good while it lasted, wasn't it Patriots fans?

   ​

   After one year and a Super Bowl title, it appears Patriots tight end
   Martellus Bennett may be headed for the exit.

   Bennett proved to be a successful stand-in for Gronkowski this season,
   hauling in 55 catches along with a career high 7 touchdowns for the
   Patriots.

   However, with great talent comes great responsibility. And a hefty
   paycheck to boot. The price may just be too much to pay to keep Bennett
   around.

     [9]#Patriots TE Martellus Bennett will test free agency. Based on
     his asking price & likely offers, it’s a real possibility he exits,
     I’m told
     — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) [10]February 22, 2017

   Recently a staple in the Patriots' system has been small, quick
   receivers alongside a dominant tight end. With Gronkowski missing half
   the regular season, and all of the playoffs, Bennett was that dominant
   force.

   Given Gronk's recent injury history, the Patriots may hurt more than we
   might think if Bennett were to leave. Gronk is starting to look like
   his health can't be completely trusted given the fact that he's missed
   significant time due to injury in two of the last four seasons.
   ​

   Keeping Bennett around is certainly in their best interests, but the
   price may just be too high.

     The [11]#Patriots helped Martellus Bennett revive his career, and
     it’s a mutually respectful relationship. But keeping him in NE will
     be hard
     — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) [12]February 22, 2017

   The reality is that the Patriots usually can make things work
   regardless of who is or isn't on the roster. As long as they have No.
   12 behind center, they always have a chance.

   However, the Patriots usually don't capture world championships absent
   of a productive tight end. If Bennett does leave, look for New England
   to fill the void regardless of Gronk's status.

   Although, after the season Bennett had, those will be mighty big shoes
   to fill.
