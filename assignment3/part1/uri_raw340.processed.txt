   Police put value on number 21 jersey at half a million dollars

   New England Patriots star quarterback Tom Brady reported that the
   jersey he wore in the Super Bowl 51 last February 5 where he led his
   football team to a record fifth win has gone missing.

   Houston police puts value of the number 12 jersey at US$500,000.

   TMZ, an American syndicated entertainment and gossip news show created
   by Harvey Levin, posted on its website a copy of a police report on the
   theft of the prized jersey.

   The theft has been classified by the police as first-degree felony.

   Brady reported the theft the day after the Superbowl 51.

   Brady said after the game, he went to the locker room of the team at
   the NRG Stadium where the Superbowl was held and put the jersey inside
   his bag. When he went back to the locker room to get his bag, the
   jersey was no longer inside.

   Brady wants it back because “its a nice piece of memorabilia.”

   “If it shows up on (buy-and-sell website) eBay somewhere, someone let
   me know so I can track that down,” said Brady, who is the husband of
   Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen. GAC/Expat Media
