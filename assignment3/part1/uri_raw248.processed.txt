   Six New England Patriots players have a message for the Trump White
   House: We're just not that into you.

   Since the team won an historic fifth Super Bowl with a stunning
   come-from-behind victory over the Atlanta Falcons in overtime on
   February 5th, a [69]growing number of players on the team have told the
   press that they would turn down an invite to commemorate their victory
   at the White House.

   And while some have not explicitly cited President Donald Trump and his
   policies as the reason — some have — and the number of players planning
   to boycott a future photo-op is unprecedented compared to years past.

   "We've never seen anything like this," Edge of Sports writer and Nation
   contributor [72]Dave Zirin told NBC News on Friday. "It has extra
   meaning coming from a team that all over social media — by both sides —
   was being called 'Team Trump.'"

   President Trump does enjoy a close personal friendship with team owner
   Robert Kraft, and has touted the endorsements of coach [73]Bill
   Belichick and star quarterback Tom Brady. In an interview with Fox
   News' Bill O'Reilly prior to the Super Bowl, he conceded that his
   public fandom was making the Patriots [74]polarizing.

   "They're taking a lot of heat. But you know what? They're also getting
   a lot of popularity out of it. I think they're going to do very well.
   Tom's a winner," he [78]said.

   Both before and after the game, tight end [79]Martellus Bennett was the
   first player to say he wouldn't join his teammates at any future White
   House celebration. Bennett made it very clear that Trump was the
   impetus for the decision.

     America was built on inclusiveness not exclusiveness.

   He was later joined by defensive back [82]Devin McCourty (who also
   participated in a silent, fists raised National Anthem protest with
   Bennett during the regular season) who said: "Basic reason for me is I
   don't feel accepted in the White House. With the president having so
   many strong opinions and prejudices, I believe certain people might
   feel accepted there while others won't."

   His sentiment was also echoed by star running back [83]LaGarrette
   Blount who said, "I don't feel welcome in that house. I'll leave it at
   that," during an appearance of "The Rich Eisen Show" Thursday.

     "I will NOT be going to the White House. I don't feel welcome in
     that house. I'll leave it at that." -[84]@LG_Blount

   Meanwhile, [86]Dont'a Hightower, [87]Chris Long and Alan Branch have
   now all also said they would turn down a request to come to the White
   House, but did not cite political motivations. And, running back
   [88]James White — who had a breakout out game for the Patriots in the
   Super Bowl — has said he is considering skipping the trip but will wait
   until an invite is put forward to decide.

   Under President Barack Obama, three players from the undefeated 1972
   Miami Dolphins turned down a photo-op at the White House over politics,
   as well as a [92]handful of other athletes.

   Brady even skipped a 2015 invitation to the Obama White House — without
   publicly giving a specific reason why.

   And Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush and
   Ronald Reagan have all presided over the [93]occasional athlete
   defection, but this snubbing feels more significant because of who this
   current commander-in-chief is and what the Patriots franchise has come
   to represent.

   In part because of Trump's attachment to the team, many sports fans
   began to see them as a red state franchise, even though ironically they
   hail from a cerulean state where every county went to Hillary Clinton
   last November.

   Even Richard Spencer, the widely reviled white nationalist, hopped on
   the Patriots bandwagon, calling their comeback win a victory for the
   [94]"NFL's Whitest team," even though their roster is close to the
   league average in terms of African-American representation.

   "People were saying this was just like election night," said Zirin.
   "That was a wildly overstated generalization and assumption made by
   people who didn't understand the team's dynamics. The idea that this
   was 'Team Trump' versus 'Team John Lewis' existed in the minds of
   pundits more than in locker rooms."

   Zirin believes that by speaking out so publicly, these Patriots players
   are sending a "huge message," that not every player on the team is
   lockstep politically with Brady and ownership, but also that they are
   not interested in being permanently linked to a [97]historically
   unpopular new president.

   Now, whether or not any of this will matter to President Trump is
   another story.

   "I never expected the President of the United States to [98]respond to
   Nordstroms," said Zirin "So I'm at a loss about how he will react to
   this."
