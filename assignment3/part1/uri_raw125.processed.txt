Martellus Bennett to fans: Stop telling me to take less money

   Posted by Mike Florio on February 22, 2017, 7:08 PM EST
   FOXBORO, MA - SEPTEMBER 18: Martellus Bennett #88 of the New England
   Patriots looks on before the game against the Miami Dolphins at
   Gillette Stadium on September 18, 2016 in Foxboro, Massachusetts.
   (Photo by Tim Bradbury/Getty Images) Getty Images

   When the Patriots traded for tight end [74]Martellus Bennett, they knew
   that: (1) he had one more year left on his contract; and (2) if he
   and/or the team had a big year, Bennett would try to parlay the
   experience into a contract potentially worth more than what the
   Patriots would be willing to pay. Indeed, the Patriots have a habit of
   trading for players in the final years of their contracts because
   if/when the players leave via free agency, the departure counts toward
   the team’s eventual haul of compensatory draft picks.

   Of course, that reality isn’t keeping some fans from lobbying Bennett
   to take less to stay in New England. To that, Bennett had this to say:
   “Stop @’ing me about taking less money. [75]You take less money
   [at] your job? All of you take a pay cut hahaha.”

   Later, he said this: “All I’m saying is cut your own [76]grass don’t be
   all in my garden f–king with my fruit while weeds are growing all over
   yours.”

   Bennett is right. Football players have a limited number of years to
   play, and they have every right to try to get as much as they can while
   they can. Owners chase every dollar they can without criticism; players
   should do the same.

   Actually, players have even more reason to pursue as much money as
   possible because they don’t own anything other than their own bodies.
   At a time when management and labor are roughly splitting the revenues,
   the players get half the revenue and the owners get all the revenue and
   all the equity.

   So go for it, Marty and every other free agent. Get paid. Use your
   leverage. And don’t apologize to any of the people who aren’t putting
   their short-term and long-term health interests on the line to engage
   in a profession that too many trivialize by calling it a “game.”

   It’s not a game. It’s a multi-billion-dollar enterprise that keeps
   growing and growing and the men who have careers that last for a blink
   of an eye in relation to the overall life of the business should do
   anything and everything to get what they can while they can.

       Deserves everything he gets. Toughed it out through some serious
       injuries, didn’t complain when the ball didn’t come his way, and
       got himself a ring.
    2. [91]ramfanmatt says: Feb 22, 2017 7:14 PM
       I’ve passed on a pay increase because I liked the situation I was
       in. That being said I can’t fault any player making as much money
       as they possibly can. Their playing careers are limited and they
       have every right to get every penny they can out of the
       opportunity. He’s had a nice career and has a ring. Get paid.
    3. [92]hockeykrishna says: Feb 22, 2017 7:15 PM
       I’m a Pats fan but I have to agree given the short lifespan of
       their career but also the long-term impact on their health there
       aren’t many 70 year old football players so while I love having
       Marty here this year I understand if he takes the money. Its the
       right thing to do
    4. [93]patfan12 says: Feb 22, 2017 7:15 PM
       Let’s put this in perspective. The average Joe might be making
       $50,000/year for 40 years. They’ll end up with $2 million. I think
       MB made double that in a single year. So asking an average person
       on the street to take less money is not a fair comparison to MB.
       No problem with MB maximizing his income but let’s not try to
       justify his situation with how an average person on the street
       might manage their situation.
    5. TheWizard says: Feb 22, 2017 7:15 PM
       Just leave. Quit whining.
    6. [94]curmudgeon13 says: Feb 22, 2017 7:16 PM
       Got the ring. Now get the bling…..
    7. RE LEE says: Feb 22, 2017 7:16 PM
       I hope you get paid tons of money, but you won’t get it from the
       Patriots.
    8. MostlyRight says: Feb 22, 2017 7:19 PM
       Arizona could use a stud blocking TE who can catch and break some
       tackles. He’d be an upgrade to Gresham, a great blocker to protect
       Palmer or open holes for David Johnson, and open opportunities for
       Fitz in the slot and the smaller, speedster WRs Brown and Nelson.
    9. somehomer says: Feb 22, 2017 7:23 PM
       Got em on the cheap
   10. [95]New England>Your Team says: Feb 22, 2017 7:24 PM
       He deserves whatever he wants. He’s a big boy, and he certainly did
       his job this year. A great asset
       But like I said earlier today, he does love media attention. He
       said some pretty foolish things, asking people if they would ever
       take a pay cut?
       Actually, people take pay cuts every day to better their lives, or
       just because they have to. It’s not ALL about the money to
       everyone, Marty. It’s about the marketability.
       His cartoon brand would also be much more marketable in a big
       market like New England as well. There’s always two ways to look at
       the spectrum.
   11. chargerdillon says: Feb 22, 2017 7:25 PM
       Zero problems with what he said. You don’t talk about another mans
       money.
   12. gstewart400 says: Feb 22, 2017 7:25 PM
       So….pretty clear he’s out the door. Draft a TE, Bill
   13. jackodn says: Feb 22, 2017 7:25 PM
       Thank you for all your efforts helping the Pats get a fifth
       championship, Mr. Bennett. It was a pleasure watching you play.
       I can’t fault you for seeking the maximum you can get, best of
       luck.
   14. breadmeatcheese says: Feb 22, 2017 7:26 PM
       bennett will pout and quit trying mid-game if he gets his feelings
       hurt;
       so this is not a good sign that he crying so soon after a title
       win.
       the pats should condsider what they got from him a win, and let him
       walk.
       im pretty sure they already signed rob housler to a futures deal,
       and he is an athletic TE that could develop under bill b’s
       tutelage.
   15. tigerlilac says: Feb 22, 2017 7:26 PM
       As a Patriots fan since 1961, I find it offensive when Pats fans
       imply there is something wrong with a player who has a chance at
       free agency choses to test the market, especially a guy like
       Bennett who played hurt.
       Mr. Bennett, thank you for your service and good luck in 2917
       whether that be with the Patriots or a new team.
   16. [96]bartor1544 says: Feb 22, 2017 7:27 PM
       Go get that Revis money!
   17. [97]johnlink00 says: Feb 22, 2017 7:27 PM
       Count me among the Patriots fans who want Marty to get paid. I hope
       it is with the Pats, but he deserves what he gets.
   18. [98]tylawspick6 says: Feb 22, 2017 7:28 PM
       1. he is nuts if he thinks a team will overpay
       2. he is too risky if he goes elsewhere in a much
       looser environment
       3. he is 30 years old
       then again, there are a lot of dumb teams out there
   19. [99]lgw91s says: Feb 22, 2017 7:29 PM
       Always do what is best for your family, Marty B. Thanks for SB LI!
       Terrific addition to the ranks this year. Wish you could have
       caught that SB winning toss in your home town.
   20. [100]kcchefs58 says: Feb 22, 2017 7:29 PM
       Yes, sports fans are hypocritical as hell.
   21. [101]ibillwt says: Feb 22, 2017 7:32 PM
       Stay. Go. Whatever. Just stop begging for a mike and camera. Don’t
       care.
   22. [102]epaminondas says: Feb 22, 2017 7:33 PM
       we did without revis, so get your $ and go in health if that’s what
       is best for you.
       The coach has demonstrated he can fill any gap
   23. [103]steelfan22 says: Feb 22, 2017 7:34 PM
       My opinion, nothing wrong with taking less for the team. However,
       the NFL career can be so short take the money if you can get a big
       raise.
   24. [104]dansardo says: Feb 22, 2017 7:34 PM
       Why the hell would any knowlegible pats fan want him back? He
       helped the pats win a SB but anyone with any brains know the party
       is over beginning year 2 with him. Thanks for the great year Marty,
       now move on with our blessing
   25. bassplucker says: Feb 22, 2017 7:36 PM
       Such a tool. Can you imagine the Bears being dumb enough to have
       him, AND Brandon Marshall, AND Jay Cutler all on the payroll at the
       same time? No wonder they’re in a 5-year rebuild now.
   26. solo681 says: Feb 22, 2017 7:36 PM
       He served his purpose for one year and now it is time to let him
       walk.
       Bennett is a Locker Room CANCER and he kept his mouth shut to get
       his Ring. He is not able to control himself beyond that.
   27. valentino8100 says: Feb 22, 2017 7:39 PM
       I don’t ever hold it against any player who wants to receive market
       value for his skills.
       Just don’t ever compare your career earnings to that of the average
       worker, and don’t ever complain about the physicality or risks of a
       job you freely chose, a job most people only get to dream of doing.
   28. thejetssuck2001 says: Feb 22, 2017 7:39 PM
       do whatever you want martellus. we will be fine without you. trust
       me when i say that.
   29. backindasaddle says: Feb 22, 2017 7:40 PM
       Go get your money Marcellus. The Pats will manage the situation
       quite adroitly like they always do and will back competing for
       another Super Bowl next year.
   30. [105]jay6666 says: Feb 22, 2017 7:42 PM
       Well, he did all the right things this year and played through
       injuries BUT all the fans knew in the end he was all about
       $$$$$$$$. That was why he played for so many teams.
       His comparison with what most people make is just SILLY!!
       Enjoy your time playing for a LOSER franchise!!! Bye-bye!!
   31. [106]ariani1985 says: Feb 22, 2017 7:42 PM
       2 yard tom agrees!
   32. cma1973 says: Feb 22, 2017 7:42 PM
       He isn’t that good, go get paid. Thanks
   33. paleandpasty says: Feb 22, 2017 7:43 PM
       So, the people who are telling him to take less money are his fans
       and are fans of the Patriots and what they accomplished. The man is
       loved by these people and they want him to stay. Everyone knows
       that the only way he is staying is to take less money, but this was
       somehow turned into a bad thing?
       I wish my fans would tell me to take less money, but i don’t have
       any fans and ceiling fans don’t talk.
   34. [107]silverhat78 says: Feb 22, 2017 7:45 PM
       Take less money Martellus 🙂
   35. jjpmn says: Feb 22, 2017 7:46 PM
       Silent majority to MB: We don’t care either way. Want more rings?
       Stay in NE for your a great shot. Want to get paid? Go elsewhere.
       It’s your life.
   36. [108]silverandblack052099 says: Feb 22, 2017 7:48 PM
       Come to the Raiders, we need a real TE and you’ll still be on a
       championship contending team.
       One other thing I would like to comment on:
       There is a line in this article that states the owners “chase ever
       dollar they can without criticism”………. The comment section of PFT
       alone is enough to prove that as an inaccurate statement.
   37. [109]publikwerks says: Feb 22, 2017 7:57 PM
       Guys(to fellow Pats fans), he’s gone. If you didn’t get that from
       “You know they overpay Super Bowl champions!”, then you’re just not
       paying attention…
       He’s a hired gun, and we got our money’s worth and more. I wish him
       all the best
   38. [110]mayoroffoxboro says: Feb 22, 2017 7:58 PM
       I have no issue with any player wanting more money. Short careers,
       increased profits for owners, salary cap increases. Would you want
       people tweeting at you to take less money at your job?
       MB toughed it out this year, never once complained and deserves it
       if someone wants to pay over his perceived value.
   39. [111]damcmp says: Feb 22, 2017 8:04 PM
       those damn football players and execs don’t live in the real
       world.. so shut it Marcellus you ain’t that good and you’ve been
       running off at the mouth since before th SB…..
   40. [112]bighoser says: Feb 22, 2017 8:06 PM
       Go and get paid what you can, Marty, in a place you want to be just
       as most of us posting here would! Would anyone sane rather play in
       NE than Cleveland all things being equal? Absolutely! But the
       reality will be that if the Browns want Marty they will have to
       outbid NE by MILLIONS for his rights. So the decision he’ll have to
       make is: how much more will a losing team have to offer me in order
       for me to leave a perennial contender? My guess is $10 million more
       in guaranteed money which MOST of us would take in a heartbeat!
   41. patsfan4lifesbchamps says: Feb 22, 2017 8:06 PM
       Those same fans would have no problem if Brady asked for more
       money. Get your money Marty, you’ve earned it.
   42. [113]nhpats says: Feb 22, 2017 8:09 PM
       Thank you for your service to the Pats this last season. I wish
       you. nothing but the best of luck in the future….unless you are
       playing against the Pats.

       Go get paid by a team that’s irrelevant… only to have them cut you
       on the way to 53.
   45. [116]bartpkelly says: Feb 22, 2017 8:22 PM
       …in a profession that too many trivialize by calling it a “game.”
       That is what many NFL players call it – so it is normal for fans to
       call it that also – so I guess the players are trivializing their
       work by calling it a game?
   46. [117]jmc8888 says: Feb 22, 2017 8:23 PM
       But what Florio forgets is that when you start calling out fans,
       you have a problem.
       Florio is right that a player, IF he wants, to try to make as much
       money as possible (different people value different things; family,
       weather, competitiveness, etc).
       But for him to put people on blast for wishing he stays is just bad
       taste on his part.
       Just be the bigger person and ignore it.
       He should be appreciative of it actually. It shows the fans want
       him to stay and values what he brings to the team.
       If he has a problem with being too connected to social media,
       perhaps he should use it less or get rid of it.
   47. [118]officialgame says: Feb 22, 2017 8:27 PM
       Take less money.
   48. [119]twinfan24 says: Feb 22, 2017 8:29 PM
       There is nothing wrong with fans hoping he resigns with the Pats,
       which likely would require less than full market value.
       At the same time, there is nothing wrong with Bennett chasing the
       money. He can decide which is more important to him, the biggest
       deal or a solid deal on a better team. Nothing wrong with either
       choice, especially since he now has a ring.
   49. thrifty says: Feb 22, 2017 8:30 PM
       He talks too much – WAY too much.
   50. RE LEE says: Feb 22, 2017 8:31 PM
       The Patriots will just find another Rent-a-Revis who would play for
       cheaper to get a SB ring, pretty much like Revis and Marty.
       Brady threw Marty the ball 2 times for the SB winning touchdown but
       Marty didn’t do it. I was thinking if that were Gronk, that would
       had been a TD. It’s a good thing White did it.
       Marty will have a lot of suitors. The Patriots pedigree is good for
       his resume.
   51. jag1959 says: Feb 22, 2017 8:39 PM
       Business is business. Bennett and New England both got what they
       wanted. Bennett blaming fans for being fans is kind of amusing
       though, they are the only ones to whom it is a game.

       He has earned the right to choose whichever deal he desires.
       I remember when NE made the deal for Martellus how people on here
       said – Don’t get him – he’s trouble, ain’t worth the headache…blah
       blah blah.
       Well he showed everyone he’s a gamer – when Gronk went on IR,
       Bennett stepped up his game – EVEN when banged-up & did EXACTLY
       what Belichick asked of him and now he’s got a SB ring for that
       good work. — Dolphin Fan

       As a Pats fan, I would like to see him back. That said, if there is
       more money out there for him, why shouldn’t he go after it?
       For the fans that would be upset about this, get a grip already.
       Business is business.
