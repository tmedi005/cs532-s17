   Ever wonder what an NFL quarterback is looking at when he takes a peak
   at his wrist band?

   Well, here’s a shot of Tom Brady’s play-call wrist band courtesy of
   [35]Reddit user /u/advillious by way of the Patriots Hall of Fame:
   [kkZi3r9.jpg]

   Imgur.com

   And this is why quarterbacks get paid so much money — they are tasked
   with memorizing all of this code and knowing exactly what it means for
   the other 10 players on the field.

   Pretty overwhelming, right? Let’s break down what these calls signify.

   Let’s go with play No. 45: “G [Gun] BROWN RT [Right] 74 HOSS X-FOLLOW”

   Those six components establish the formation, the pass protection, and
   the routes the receivers are to run.

   Formation: “Gun” tells the QB to line up in shot gun, in the Patriots
   system “Brown” is an empty formation (no running backs) with three
   receivers to one side and two to the other and “right” tells the tight
   end what side of the formation to line up on.

   Protection: “74” signifies a five-man, empty protection. The video
   below goes into more detail.

   Routes: “HOSS” is a combination of a short hook route (or a “hitch”)
   and a vertical route down the seam. Hitch + Seam = HOSS. And “X-FOLLOW”
   is a combo with the slot receiver running an out route and the outside
   receiver (the “X” receiver) running a “follow” route, which, in this
   case, is an in-breaking route.

   Here’s the play drawn up:

   hossxfollow

   Further complicating matters for the quarterback, certain receivers
   will convert their routes based on the coverage the defense is playing.
   So on this particular play — one of 45 he has to internalize — Brady
   has to be aware of five receivers running seven different routes while
   diagnosing the defensive play-call … and he has only three seconds to
   process all of this information before a 300-pound man drives him into
   the dirt.

   Playing quarterback in the NFL is hard.

   For a more extensive breakdown of “HOSS X-FOLLOW,” here’s former
   Patriots offensive coordinator Bill O’Brien going into the fine details
   with video examples:

   Also, check out [37]this fantastic piece by Grantland’s Chris Brown on
   the Patriots’ play-calling system.

   And if you’re feeling adventurous, [38]here’s a copy of New England’s
   offensive playbook from the Charlie Weis days.
