NFL Executives Reveal 6 Teams That Could Trade for Patriots' Jimmy Garoppolo

   Josh Dhani [8]Josh Dhani Wednesday, February 22, 2017 0
   [9][jimmy-g.jpg]
   Jimmy Garoppolo played very well when filling in for Tom Brady for the
   first three games of the New England Patriots' 2016 Super Bowl-winning
   season.
   With two rings under his belt and some impressive play so far whenever
   he's on the field, he may be a hot commodity this offseason for teams
   in need of a quarterback.
   [10]ESPN spoke to five NFL executives about ideal trade partners for
   Jimmy G, and [11]six teams were discovered.
   Let's take a look at them.

Cleveland Browns

   [12][browns.jpg]
   Lower offer: 2017 second-rounder and 2017 fifth-rounder
   Higher offer: 2017 first-rounder (No. 12) and a 2018 conditional
   fourth-rounder

     “New England doesn't love No. 1 picks,” one of the insiders told
     Sando. “They love seconds and thirds. If they pick 32nd and then
     they pick again early in the second round with a pick they acquire,
     they are studying all the same players.”

San Francisco 49ers

   Lower offer: 2017 second-rounder and 2017 fifth-rounder
   Higher offer: 2017 second-rounder and 2018 first-rounder

     “The Bradford trade was one of the biggest panic moves of all time,
     and you can say it made sense for Minnesota to do it, but I did not
     think that was the case, and I don't think that becomes the market,”
     one executive told Sando. “Philly basically got bailed out by a team
     that was desperate.”

Chicago Bears

   [14][Screen%2BShot%2B2017-02-22%2Bat%2B11.15.09%2BPM.png]
   Lower offer: 2017 second-rounder and 2017 fifth-rounder, plus a
   conditional 2018 choice TBD
   Higher offer: 2017 second-rounder and 2018 first-rounder, plus a
   conditional 2018 choice TBD

     "I could even see Chicago giving up the No. 3 pick," one of the
     insiders said. "If I were them, I wouldn't want to give up more than
     that. At the end of the day, I don't think Garoppolo is going to get
     traded. I think a lot of this [is] mental exercise unless a team,
     like, just throws out something crazy."

New York Jets

   [15][Screen%2BShot%2B2017-02-22%2Bat%2B11.16.27%2BPM.png]
   Lower offer: 2017 second-round and 2017 fifth-rounder, plus a
   conditional 2018 choice TBD
   Higher offer: 2017 first-rounder (No. 6), plus a conditional 2018
   choice TBD

     “Who would give up a 1 for Garoppolo?" an insider asked Sando. “Me
     thinking out loud, not Cleveland, not Chicago, not San Francisco.
     For some reason, I think the Jets would give a first. And then the
     Patriots would take the high first [sixth overall] not because they
     necessarily want the great player but because they could flip that
     pick for more picks if they wanted to.”

   “You want a lot of positive going on in the offseason, and with the
   Jets, do they become even more desperate with Darrelle Revis'
   situation, where they might have to cut him and they need a rebound?”
   this insider asked Sando. “I think they would give the sixth [overall]
   pick and something else. And at the end of the day, I think New England
   would rather trade Garoppolo in the division.
   “If you are New England, you know what the quarterback is and you know
   he is your system guy who is good with your staff. You get stronger and
   make your division rival weaker because they do not get the great
   player in the draft. They get the OK quarterback. Teams are so afraid
   of trading in the division. You think New England worries about the
   Jets making them look bad? That is comical, almost.”

Buffalo Bills

   [16][Screen%2BShot%2B2017-02-22%2Bat%2B11.19.16%2BPM.png]
   Lower offer: 2017 second-rounder and 2017 fifth-rounder, plus a
   conditional 2018 choice TBD
   Higher offer: 2017 first-rounder (No. 10) and a conditional 2018 pick
   TBD

     “Buffalo had initially offered only a 2003 second-rounder that could
     upgrade to a first if Bledsoe started at least 12 games and the
     Bills reached the playoffs,” Sando reports. “The Bills agreed to the
     higher price [future first] after missing out on Patrick Ramsey in
     the draft.”

Houston Texans

   [17][texans.jpg]
   Lower offer: 2017 second-rounder
   Higher offer: N/A

     The Texans could throw out a low offer for Garoppolo or a
     player-for-player swap. One executive asked if the Patriots would
     consider a Garoppolo-for-WR DeAndre Hopkins trade, but added “New
     England would take a loss, though, because they would have to pay
     Hopkins.”
