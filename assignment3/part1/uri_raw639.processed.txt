Film Review: Patriots Day

   I have a hard time with movies that are docudramas about terrorism
   since 9/11.  That isn't to say that these movies are bad.  But they hit
   me in an exceedingly emotional way.  Sometimes I think my critiques of
   them are more visceral rather than artistic because they represent and
   portray the world that we all live in today.
   And Patriots Day is no exception.
   The movie, directed by Peter Berg, depicts the events of the Boston
   Marathon Bombing of 2013.  The movie is an ensemble piece taking a look
   at the attack from several different points of view.  The main
   character is Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg) a fictional Boston police
   officers who is the primary way most of the characters will be
   connected.  The rest of the cast includes Tommy's wife Carol (Michelle
   Monaghan), Commisioner Ed Davis (John Goodman), Sgt. Jeffrey Pugliese
   (JK Simmons), Special Agent Richard DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon) and many
   others.  While Tommy provides a major through-line in the film, it is
   really made up of smaller vignettes of the events told from various
   perspectives.
   While the events of the movie are only a few years old, director Peter
   Berg weighs the sensitivities while creating a compelling drama.  Some
   have criticized that the movie is too soon.  But if it has any
   potential flaw in this regard its that all of the real-life characters
   (with the exception of the bombers and accomplices) are treated with
   very little criticism.  It's not that the movie would be served by
   being a hatchet job on any particular individual, but you can almost
   feel the gentle treatment given to people, particularly political
   figures.
   But with aside, Patriots Day works incredibly well as a film.  One of
   the challenges of doing a story based on famous news events is that you
   can lose a lot of the dramatic tension because we know how the story
   starts and ends.  But Berg never lets us feel safe.  In fact, the
   moment the bomb goes off, even though we know its coming, is an
   incredible shock on screen.
   The movie is surprisingly tense.  As we follow the path of the bombers
   we see other innocents who get caught up in their crimes.  Alex Wolff
   and Themo Melikidze do an excellent job as the Tsarnaev brothers.  The
   evil and hatred that emanate off of them is so palpable.  The movie
   goes out of its way to make sure that Muslims are not broadly
   demonized, but Berg never shows the monsters behind the attack in any
   kind of sympathetic light.  Rather than being a detriment to the story,
   this simply raises the stakes for our heroes who have to stand up to
   this utter evil.  I found myself emotionally invested in the story in a
   way that I am normally not.  My anger rises at the events on screen as
   I think about how evil men like these terrorists are work in the world
   I live in now.
   The imagery is incredibly powerful.  One trooper is ordered to stand
   guard over the body of a young boy who was killed.  And hours after
   everyone else has gone, he stands at his lone post, watchful.  And when
   the body is taken away, he tearfully salutes the fallen child.  Berg
   fills his movie with other strong images of Boston, giving the city a
   strong sense of character.
   The performances are also top notch.  Simmons, Goodman, Monaghan, and
   Bacon are all at the top of their game.  But the real standout is
   Wahlberg.  He goes through the entire gamut of emotions.  He doesn't
   play Tommy with too much sympathy or cynicism.  You can see the
   physical, psychological, and emotional toll the story takes on him.
   Also, towards the end of the movie, Wahlberg gives one of the best
   movie speeches I've heard in years.  When reflecting on the evil in the
   world and what to do about it, he says, “When the devil hits you like
   that the only way to fight back is with love…That’s the only thing he
   won’t touch.”  As a Catholic, I was surprised at how beautifully and
   succinctly Christian that message was.
   The movie does end with interviews and footage of the real-life
   survivors of the event.  This is an increasing trend that we see in
   movies like American Sniper and Hacksaw Ridge.  And while the effect is
   powerful, its strength is a bit diluted by going on a bit too long.  It
   hands just a little too much of the movie over to feeling like 60
   minutes.  Berg should have taken a cue from Spielberg's Schindler's
   List which used the real-life people in a silent and powerful epilogue
   to the film.
   Patriots Day is an excellent movie.  It almost makes you forget that
   Berg also directed the atrocious Battleship.  But this film completely
   gets him out of the cinematic dog house.
   This movie is well worth your time.

MOVIE MORAL METRICS (for reading film reviews on this blog)

   Objectionable = the content is strongly negative and may have negative
   effects on some viewers
   Mature = the content may be objectionable to some, but it should only
   be viewed by someone mature enough to properly process the content
   Acceptable = the content may have a few morally questionable items, but
   it does not have enough immorality to make it mature or objectionable,
   but it does not necessarily support good morality
   No Objection: it's all good!

Prayer to St. Joseph for a Difficult Problem

   O Glorious St. Joseph, thou who hast power to render possible even
   things which are considered impossible, come to our aid in our present
   trouble and distress. Take this important and difficult affair under
   thy particular protection, that it may end happily. (MENTION YOUR
   REQUEST)

   O dear St. Joseph, all our confidence is in thee. Let it not be said
   that we would invoke thee in vain; and since thou art so powerful with
   Jesus and Mary, show that thy goodness equals thy power. Amen.
   St. Joseph, friend of the Sacred Heart, pray for us.

Avila Prayer

   Let nothing disturb you,
   Let nothing frighten you,
   All things are passing away:
   God never changes.
   Patience obtains all things
   Whoever has God lacks nothing;
   God alone suffices.
   – St. Teresa of Avila

About Me

   [18]My photo

   [19]Catholic Skywalker
          A little about me: I am a devoutly Catholic theology teacher who
          loves a popular culture that often, quite frankly, hates me.  I
          grew up absorbing every movie, TV show, comic book, science
          fiction novel, etc. I could find.  As of today I’ve watched over
          2100 movies and tv shows.  They take up a huge part of my life.
          I don’t know that this is a good thing, but it has given me a
          common vocabulary to draw from in order to illustrate whatever
          theological point I make in class.  I’ve used American Pie the
          song to explain the Book of Revelation (I’ll post on this some
          time later) and American Pie the movie to help explain Eucharist
          (don’t ask).  The point is that the popular culture is popular
          for a reason.  It is woven into the fabric of our lives and
          imaginations, for good or ill.  In this blog I will attempt to
          bring together the things of heaven with the things of earth.
          Of course this goal may be too lofty for someone like me.
