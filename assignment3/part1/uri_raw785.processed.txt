   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. —

   This is where the magic happens, here in the New England Patriots
   locker room.

   John Duke Logan will be walking through as the players are taping up
   their ankles or putting on pads and one of them - most often backup
   quarterback Jacoby Brissett - will shout at him, "What do you have for
   me today?" Logan reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a deck of
   cards, and soon a crowd is gathered around.

   "I saw him in there a couple of weeks ago and he did some amazing
   things," quarterback Tom Brady said. "I think everyone is blown away by
   a little magic."

   As Brady spoke at his weekly news conference, Logan was in the back of
   the media workroom at Gillette Stadium, shooting video for his actual
   job as digital content associate for the Patriots website. But it's as
   a sort of official team magician that he has attracted a following
   among the AFC champions, who will be playing the Atlanta Falcons in the
   Super Bowl on Sunday

   "Anytime you can kind of take your mind off of football when you're in
   the locker room, it's a nice little break from the reality of what we
   do every day," fullback James Develin said. "It just keeps things light
   and it's fun to come to work every day."

   A 23-year-old native of nearby Hanover, Massachusetts, Logan was 12
   when he posted a trick on YouTube and attracted the attention of a
   talent manager. (When the caller tried pitch some gigs, Logan told him,
   "I'll have to ask my mom.") By the time he graduated with two majors
   (entrepreneurship, marketing) and a minor (communications) from Bryant
   College in Rhode Island, where the Patriots used to train, Logan had
   already written two books about using the principles of magic as a tool
   to accomplish one's life goals.

   One of his mantras: "Magic isn't about tricking people, it's about
   proving to people that impossible is just a word."

   A longtime Patriots fan, Logan applied for a job in the team's digital
   department. During the interview, his future boss proposed the idea
   that became the "Magic Moments" section on the website

   Each week this season, he produced a video performing a magic trick
   with a player or group of cheerleaders. Tailoring the routines to the
   specific player, he used Jamaican songs with Jamaica native Patrick
   Chung ; with Malcom Butler, whose interception clinched New England's
   last Super Bowl win, the trick was called "A Perfect Catch" and was
   also timed to appear during the NFL's breast cancer awareness month.

   But Logan quickly became a celebrity among celebrities. He has a few
   rules in the locker room: He won't approach players in the locker room,
   but he will perform a trick if requested.

   "I realize they have a job to do. The last thing I want is to be a
   distraction to them," he said. "Jacoby wanted to see a trick this week
   and last week, too, and I said, 'Jacoby, I want you to focus on the
   game.'"

   As a part-time Patriots employee, Logan didn't travel with the team to
   Houston; instead, he was planning to head down midweek to perform at
   Guy Fieri's tailgate party. In an interview near the stadium during
   Super Bowl week, Logan reached into the pocket of his Patriots jacket
   and pulled out a deck of cards. ("I always travel with a deck of
   cards," he said. "You never know what's going to happen.")

   First, he used Siri on his iPhone to correctly guess a reporter's card
   (the three of diamonds) - a version of the trick he recorded with Chung
   for the website. Other tricks made cards move from one end of the deck
   to another, or seem to change their spots in his hands.

   Watching such accomplished athletes dissolve in befuddlement is the
   real feat, Logan said.

   "Magic isn't the trick. It's what happens after the trick," he said. "I
   thought Devin McCourty was this big, tough guy - which he is. But when
   you do magic, it brings them back to their childhood."

   As a New England high school football player who has done magic half
   his life, Logan has apparently apparated into his dream job. There's
   only one problem: Being the unofficial magician for an organization
   that has twice been convicted by the NFL of trickery makes some
   out-of-towners even more suspicious.

   "People don't like the Patriots. They hate them. It's kind of New
   England against the world," Logan said. "I was afraid people would say,
   'Oh, it's another way they're cheating.'"

   But, he insists, there's no hocus-pocus that the rest of the league
   needs to worry about.

   "I'm not sure if Bill Belichick - Coach Belichick - knows that I do
   magic," Logan said. "He says: 'You always focus on football.' And even
   if he does know who I am, that's what I want him to continue doing: I
   want him to focus on football, and going all the way."

   If they do, don't expect Logan to take any credit.

   "Belichick is the real magician. Belichick and Brady," he said,
   breaking into a wry smile like so many of his willing victims. "I don't
   even know how they do it every year."
