     * [16]Rapoport: Cutler considering early retirement
     * [17]Ranking the top landing spots for Tony Romo

   [18]More Columns >

   What is [19]Jay Cutler's football future if the [20]Chicago Bears are
   unsuccessful in their [21]quest to trade the veteran quarterback
   leading up to the new league year on March 9?

   If he is left without an attractive home once the offseason's game of
   quarterback musical chairs comes to a close, it's not inconceivable
   that Cutler will opt for early retirement.

   "He's one of several veterans who are [22]still considering whether
   they want to play, whether they want to not play, retire, walk away,"
   NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport explained on Wednesday's edition of
   NFL Total Access. "A lot of things in play here for [23]Jay Cutler."

   The other veteran quarterbacks Rapoport alluded to are [24]Carson
   Palmer, [25]Ben Roethlisberger and [26]Tony Romo, all of whom have
   contemplated retirement since the end of the 2016 season.

   Palmer has since [27]committed to the Cardinals, while Roethlisberger
   and Romo are expected to play provided their bodies cooperate and their
   football situations are to their liking.

   This isn't to suggest that Cutler has one foot out the door as he
   enters his mid-thirties. It's simply the new reality of the modern NFL
   in which established quarterbacks settling into their twilight years
   adopt a year-to-year approach, taking the time to weigh whether it's
   worthwhile to continue playing after setting themselves and their
   families up for life.

   Cutler is working out and getting ready to play in 2017. He's doing
   well in his recovery from labrum surgery, per Rapoport, and is expected
   to be healthy soon.

   If Cutler is presented with a starting job on the right team at the
   right price, he will be under center in Week 1. If his best option is
   to compete for playing time and guaranteed money in a tailspinning
   organization, motivation will naturally become a major factor in his
   decision-making process.
