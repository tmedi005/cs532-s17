[12]George Soros Finances Group Helping Facebook Flag ‘Disputed’ Stories

   Posted on [13]December 16, 2016 by [14]admin

TEL AVIV — The organization partnered with Facebook to help determine whether
a certain story is “disputed” is financed by billionaire George Soros and a
slew of other left-wing funders.

   The International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) drafted a code of five
   principles for news websites to accept, and Facebook yesterday
   announced it will work with “third-party fact checking organizations”
   that are signatories to the code of principles.

   Facebook [15]says that if the “fact checking organizations” determine
   that a certain story is fake, it will get flagged as disputed and,
   according to the Facebook announcement, “there will be a link to the
   corresponding article explaining why. Stories that have been disputed
   may also appear lower in News Feed.”

   IFCN is [17]hosted by the Poynter Institute for Media Studies. A
   cursory search of the Poynter Institute website finds that Poynter’s
   IFCN is openly funded by Soros’ Open Society Foundations as well as the
   Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Google, and the National Endowment for
   Democracy.

   Poynter’s IFCN is also funded by the Omidyar Network, which is the
   nonprofit for liberal billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. The
   Omidyar Network has [18]partnered with the Open Society on numerous
   projects and it has given [19]grants to third parties using the
   Soros-funded Tides Foundation.  Tides is one of the largest donors to
   left-wing causes in the U.S.

   Another significant Poynter Institute donor is the Craig Newmark
   Foundation, the charitable organization established by Craigslist
   Founder Craig Newmark. On Monday, just days before the announcement of
   the Facebook partnership, Poynter issued a [20]press release revealing
   that Newmark donated $1 million to the group to fund a faculty chair in
   journalism ethics.

   States the press release:

     The gift will support a five-year program at Poynter that focuses on
     verification, fact-checking and accountability in journalism. It’s
     the largest donation Poynter’s ever received from an individual
     foundation.

     The Newmark Chair will expand on Poynter’s teaching in journalism
     ethics and develop certification programs for journalists that
     commit to ethical decision-making practices. The faculty member will
     also organize an annual conference on ethics issues at Poynter and
     be a regular contributor to Poynter.org.

   Newmark funds [21]scores of liberal groups also financed by Soros,
   including the Sierra Club, the New America Foundation, and the Sunlight
   Foundation.

   Newmark also [22]finances the investigative journalism group called the
   Center for Public Integrity, where he serves on the board.  Soros’ Open
   Society is [23]another Public Integrity donor.

   Soros has earned his megafortune in part by short selling currencies
   and causing economic crises. He is credited with breaking the pound on
   September 16, 1992 in a day that became known in Britain as “Black
   Wednesday.” He [24]reportedly made $1.2 billion from that crisis.  In
   2002, he was [25]convicted for insider trading.

   Poynter, meanwhile, has hosted controversial journalism programs in the
   past, including one that was accused of downplaying the threat of
   global Islamic terrorism. FoxNews.com [26]reported the course suggested
   reporters “keep the death toll from Islamic terrorism in ‘context’ by
   comparing that toll to the number of people killed every year by
   malaria, HIV/AIDS and other factors.”

   The course taught reporters that the term “jihad” means internal
   struggle, and it discussed what it claimed was the issue of “right-wing
   activists” attempting to link American Muslims to terrorism.

   Continued FoxNews.com:

   The section includes the good-journalism tip that reporters should
   check to see if experts they’re interviewing “have a bias or a stake in
   the story you are covering.” But then it only cites examples of
   anti-Muslim groups.

   The course in Islam, Fox News reported, was supported by a group
   calling itself the Social Science Research Council, which has received
   funding from Soros-financed groups.

   In response to the report, the Poynter Institute explained that it
   created the course “as a tool for journalists who want to be accurate
   in educating their audience about the religion and culture of Islam,
   Muslim communities in the U.S., and the distinctions between Islam as a
   political movement and the radical philosophies that inspire militant
   Islamists.”

   “We believe there is a need to better understand the complexities of
   Muslim societies and the online course offered by Poynter and
   Washington State University is a vital resource toward that end,”
   Poynter added.

   “The values underpinning the course are truth, accuracy, independence,
   fairness, minimizing harm and context — the core journalistic values on
   which we build all our teaching here at Poynter.”

   Poynter’s IFCN [27]code of principles for news outlets, meanwhile,
   reads as follows:

     1. A COMMITMENT TO NONPARTISANSHIP AND FAIRNESS

     We fact-check claims using the same standard for every fact check.
     We do not concentrate our fact-checking on any one side. We follow
     the same process for every fact check and let the evidence dictate
     our conclusions. We do not advocate or take policy positions on the
     issues we fact-check.

     2. A COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY OF SOURCES

     We want our readers to be able to verify our findings themselves. We
     provide all sources in enough detail that readers can replicate our
     work, except in cases where a source’s personal security could be
     compromised. In such cases, we provide as much detail as possible.

     3. A COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY OF FUNDING & ORGANIZATION

     We are transparent about our funding sources. If we accept funding
     from other organizations, we ensure that funders have no influence
     over the conclusions we reach in our reports. We detail the
     professional background of all key figures in our organization and
     explain our organizational structure and legal status. We clearly
     indicate a way for readers to communicate with us.

     4. A COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY OF METHODOLOGY

     We explain the methodology we use to select, research, write, edit,
     publish and correct our fact checks. We encourage readers to send us
     claims to fact-check and are transparent on why and how we
     fact-check.

     5. A COMMITMENT TO OPEN AND HONEST CORRECTIONS

     We publish our corrections policy and follow it scrupulously. We
     correct clearly and transparently in line with our corrections
     policy, seeking so far as possible to ensure that readers see the
     corrected version.

[36]FBI New York Field Office Told To Continue Clinton Foundation Probe

   Posted on [37]December 16, 2016 by [38]admin

   Officials at FBI headquarters instructed its New York field office to
   continue its corruption investigation into the Clinton Foundation
   following the election of Republican candidate Donald Trump, according
   to a former senior law enforcement official.

   The instructions ordered agents to “go forward” with their ongoing
   inquiry into the Clinton Foundation which is focusing on issues of
   corruption and money laundering, according to the source.

   “There were no instructions to shut it down, to discontinue or to stand
   down on the investigation, but to continue its work,” the former
   official told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an interview.

   He said he received this information about a week ago and that the
   order originated from the bureau’s headquarters in Washington, D.C.
   well after the November 8 election.  He did not know who at FBI
   Headquarters issued the order.

   The same source [39]broke the news to TheDCNF that the FBI was
   conducting a multi-city probe of the foundation in as many as five
   cities: New York, Little Rock, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Miami.
   The source did not know the status of the bureau’s work in the four
   other cities.

   After the election, President-elect Donald Trump indicated that
   prosecuting rival Hillary Clinton or her foundation would not be a
   priority.

   In an interview with the New York Times on November 21, he said, “I
   don’t want to hurt the Clintons, I really don’t.”

   But he didn’t rule out a continuing probe of the foundation, saying,
   “we’ll have people that do things,” on the foundation, which the Times
   wrote was, “perhaps a reference to the F.B.I. or Republicans who might
   continue to press for prosecutions in the email or foundation cases.”

   It’s rare for a president to stop an FBI investigation.  Halting an
   ongoing probe by the FBI, which is an independent law enforcement
   agency, can be fraught with many political risks for presidents and can
   expose them to charges of interfering or politicizing law enforcement
   activities.

   The Clinton Foundation originally started in Little Rock, Arkansas as
   the main nonprofit entity to build and maintain the presidential
   library for former President Bill Clinton.

   As its activities exploded in the United States and overseas, its
   operations migrated to New York City.

   In 2015, the foundation reported it had 528 full-time employees, most
   of them working in offices located on Wall Street.  It’s net assets in
   2015 were $347 million [40]according to its Form 990 tax filing with
   the Internal Revenue Service.

   The charity moved in 2011 from Harlem to Wall Street where they shared
   offices with the investment giant Goldman Sachs, [41]according to
   WikiLeaks.

   The move to Wall Street doubled the foundation’s rent, from $1.8
   million to $4 million, according to the charity’s Form 990.

   The spark for the FBI investigation appeared to be secret recordings of
   suspects in Los Angeles involved in money laundering activities who
   mentioned the Clinton Foundation.    The disclosure triggered an
   investigation in that city beginning last February, [42]according to
   the Wall Street Journal.

   Other FBI bureaus also opened probes of the foundation in other cities.

   On numerous occasions bureau agents also conferred with Peter
   Schweizer, who chronicled the money flows into the charity from
   influential and wealthy people and foreign governments and wrote about
   it in his book titled, “Clinton Cash.”

   FBI Director James Comey has been criticized by both Democrats and
   Republicans for his decisions on probing Hillary Clinton over her use
   of a private email server for government business.  He ended an
   investigation in July of this year of her email but then resurrected it
   just 10 days before the election when her emails showed up in a laptop
   owned by former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner.

   Weiner, who is married to Clinton aide Huma Abedin, is reportedly being
   investigated on child pornography grounds when he allegedly “sexted”
   with underage girls.

   Senior Justice Department officials reportedly were openly skeptical of
   the Clinton Foundation case and repeatedly tried to shut down the
   bureau’s probe.  But the department was not able to shut down the FBI
   activities.

   The transition team’s announcement comes in advance of Trump’s
   Wednesday meeting with top tech leaders, including Musk, at Trump
   Tower.

   Other key tech players expected to be at the meeting include Facebook’s
   Sheryl Sandberg; Eric Schmidt and Larry Page of Alphabet, Google’s
   parent company; and Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon who also owns The
   Washington Post. A representative from Uber will not be in attendance.

   “I look forward to engaging with our incoming President and this group
   on issues that affect our riders, drivers and the 450+ cities where we
   operate,” Kalanick said in a statement.

   Musk, Kalanick and Nooyi will join 13 other members of the President’s
   Strategic and Policy Forum who are expected to “meet with the President
   frequently to share their specific experience and knowledge as the
   President implements his economic agenda.”

   The forum will be chaired by Stephen A. Schwarzman, the CEO and
   co-founder of Blackstone, one of the world’s largest private equity
   firms.

   “America has the most innovative and vibrant companies in the world,
   and the pioneering CEOs joining this Forum today are at the top of
   their fields,” Trump said in a statement.

   “My Administration is going to work together with the private sector to
   improve the business climate and make it attractive for firms to create
   new jobs across the United States from Silicon Valley to the
   heartland.”

[60]ATTN GEORGIA RESIDENTS: Manhunt under way after 1 Georgia cop killed, 1
seriously injured in shooting

   Posted on [61]December 7, 2016 by [62]admin

   Watch the latest video at [63]video.foxnews.com

   A manhunt was launched Wednesday for the shooter responsible for
   killing one Georgia police officer and critically wounding another in
   an incident that triggered a lockdown at nearby Georgia Southwestern
   State College.

   [64]VIDEO REPORTEDLY CLEARS DETROIT MAN ACCUSED IN KILLING OF
   UNIVERSITY POLICE OFFICER

   Minguell Kennedy Lembrick, 32, was named as the alleged shooter by a
   spokesperson for the Albany Police Department, [65]WGXA reported.
   Authorities consider Lembrick armed and dangerous.

   “There are no words to express the pain and sorrow,” Americus Police
   Chief Mark [66]Scott said. Officials did not name the officers
   involved.

   The officer who was killed was from the Americus Police Dept. Another
   officer from Georgia Southwestern State University had been placed on a
   Life Flight to a hospital in Macon, Scott said. Both officers had head
   wounds, [68]WSB reported. Neither officer was named.

   The shooting unfolded just after 9:30 a.m. at the Country Club Estates
   apartments. The Americus officer went to the complex on a domestic
   disturbance call and the GSW officer arrived as backup, Scott told
   WGXA.

   “A shooting has taken place off campus near the south side of the
   Griffin Bell Golf Course,” [70]a statement from GSW said. “Students,
   faculty and staff should remain in their present location until further
   notice.”

   The alert advised those on lockdown to secure doors and windows, shut
   off lights and move away from doors. No students were injured during
   the incident, the school said in a tweet.

   Americus is about 75 miles southwest of Macon.

[75]Ed Klein: Hillary Clinton’s Campaign Joined Jill Stein’s Recount Effort
to Raise Her Spirits

   Posted on [76]December 5, 2016 by [77]admin

   Ed Klein with the interesting tidbits of information [78]about Hillary
   Clinton post-Election Day loss to Donald Trump:

     Part of the answer is that people close to Hillary—Huma Abedin,
     Chelsea Clinton, and Sidney Blumenthal—encouraged her to ask for a
     recount as a way of lifting her spirits.

     “She is weepy, looks ten years older and is very whiny,” said one of
     Hillary’s closest friends. “She has been drinking wine pretty
     heavily, much more than usual. She mopes around all day, swimming in
     a sea of recriminations and complaining that her campaign managers
     were ‘incompetent,’ Bill and Chelsea ‘didn’t work hard enough,’ FBI
     Director Comey was ‘in league with Trump.’”

     In addition, President Obama convinced Hillary that it was in the
     best interest of the Democratic Party if the Clinton legal team got
     involved with the recount and didn’t leave it to Jill Stein.

[87]VET DIES: 4 VA Hospital Employees Resign After Maggots Found in Vet’s
Wound

   Posted on [88]December 5, 2016 by [89]admin

   Can we just inaugurate Trump now?

   FROM [90]FOX NEWS: Troubling revelations are coming out of a VA
   hospital in Oklahoma City. This is just heart-breaking.

   Myles Deering, executive director of the VA medical center in Talihina,
   Oklahoma, said four employees have resigned after maggots were
   discovered in the wound of a 73-year-old veteran, who later died of
   sepsis.

   Deering said the maggots were found while the patient, Owen Reese
   Peterson, was still alive and were not the only contributing factor to
   his death.

   Monday on America’s Newsroom, host Bill Hemmer asked Fox News
   contributor Pete Hegseth, a veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan,
   about the state of VA hospitals nationwide.

[96]Jeff Sessions Desegregated Alabama Schools and Got the Death Penalty for
KKK Murderer

   Posted on [97]November 29, 2016 by [98]admin

   Now that Jeff Sessions is Donald Trump’s pick for attorney general,
   you’re going to hear a lot of people dig up old accusations that
   Sessions is a racist. In fact, [99]CNN did so last night. However,
   between the nature of the accusations and Sessions’s actual record of
   desegregating schools and taking on the Klan in Alabama, it strains
   credulity to believe that he is a racist.

   These accusations all center around the bruising judicial nomination
   process Sessions went through in 1986. Ronald Reagan had tapped
   Sessions to serve on the federal bench and the Senate judiciary
   committee ultimately rejected him after they heard testimony that he
   had supposedly called the ACLU and NAACP “un-American” and
   “communist-inspired,” as well as made racist remarks. The accusations
   came from Thomas Figures, a black assistant U.S. attorney who worked
   for Sessions who said Sessions called him “boy” and had made a joke
   about how he thought the KKK was “O.K. until [he] found out they smoked
   pot.” Another prosecutor, J. Gerald Hebert, said Sessions had called a
   white lawyer “a disgrace to his race” for representing black clients.

   IFRAME: [100]https://www.youtube.com/embed/oOjovdMKiRM?rel=0&showinfo=0

   There is no concrete reason to doubt Figures or Herbert. Sessions
   vehemently denied calling Figures “boy,” but he didn’t rebut the
   substance of some of the claims—though he asserted they were taken out
   of context. It’s not exactly inaccurate to point out that the NAACP and
   ACLU were “communist-inspired.” He said he thought it absurd to think
   he would make a pro-KKK joke considering he was prosecuting the Klan at
   the time he made the remark. And for what it’s worth, Figures also
   directed accusations at a another assistant U.S. Attorney who worked
   with Figures. That assistant U.S. Attorney also said Figures wasn’t
   telling the truth and defended Sessions’s integrity. Ultimately, the
   charges were no more than hearsay.

   Original from [101]WEEKLY STANDARD

   However, it’s worth noting that Senator Ted Kennedy, on the Senate
   judiciary committee at the time, seemed heavily invested in tanking
   Sessions nomination. The next year, Kennedy’s crusade was to sink
   Robert Bork’s nomination to the Supreme Court, which has generally been
   regarded as a shameful smear campaign ever since. The episode upended
   the comity that had previously existed between the Senate and the White
   House on Supreme Court nominations—Antonin Scalia was approved to the
   court 98-0 the year before, the same year that Sessions was filleted by
   Kennedy and Democrats on the judiciary committee. Perhaps Sessions was
   a trial run for “Borking.”

   In 2009, [102]Sessions himself told me that “When I got to Washington,
   there had been an orchestrated campaign to smear my record, and it was
   executed with great care. And I, frankly, was a babe in the woods and
   wasn’t sufficiently prepared for it.” For that reason, when Sessions
   got to the Senate he has always been more deferential toward
   nominations than most of his GOP colleagues. For instance, he was one
   of the only Republican senators to support Eric Holder’s nomination for
   attorney general.

   Sessions’s actual track record certainly doesn’t suggest he’s a racist.
   Quite the opposite, in fact. As a U.S. Attorney he filed several cases
   to desegregate schools in Alabama. And he also prosecuted Klansman
   Henry Francis Hays, son of Alabama Klan leader [103]Bennie Hays, for
   abducting and killing Michael Donald, a black teenager selected at
   random. Sessions insisted on the death penalty for Hays. When he was
   later elected the state Attorney General, Sessions followed through and
   made sure Hays was executed. The successful prosecution of Hays also
   led to a $7 million civil judgment against the Klan, effectively
   breaking the back of the KKK in Alabama.

   As a U.S. attorney, he also prosecuted a group of civil rights
   activists, which included a former aide to Martin Luther King Jr., for
   voter fraud in Perry County, Alabama. The case fell apart, and Sessions
   bluntly told me he “failed to make the case.” This incident has also
   been used to claim that Sessions is racist—but it shouldn’t be. The
   county has been dogged with accusations of voter fraud for decades. In
   2008, state and federal officials [104]investigated voter fraud in
   Perry County after “a local citizens group gathered affidavits
   detailing several cases in which at least one Democratic county
   official paid citizens for their votes, or encouraged them to vote
   multiple times.” A [105]detailed story in the [106]Tuscaloosa News
   reported that voting patterns in one Perry County town were also mighty
   suspicious in 2012: “Uniontown has a population of 1,775, according to
   the 2010 census but, according to the Perry County board of registrars,
   has 2,587 registered voters. The total votes cast
   thereTuesday—1,431—represented a turnout of 55 percent of the number of
   registered voters and a whopping 80.6 percent of the town’s
   population.”

   Perhaps there are a lot of ideological reasons for liberals to be upset
   about Sessions becoming attorney general. But I don’t think the
   character attacks on the man can be taken seriously.

   Correction: A previous version of this post identified Henry Francis
   Hays as an Alabama KKK head. He was actually the son of one: Bennie
   Hays, who, per his obituary, was accused of “instigating” the murder
   for which Henry Hays was executed. The story has been updated.

   Update: Suffice it to say, because I didn’t specifically detail
   Sessions involvement in the prosecution of Hays’s case, some online
   critics are claiming I’m trying to give Sessions credit for something
   he did not do. The short answer is that’s not what happened, but the
   long answer is that it’s complicated. Let’s review [107]what I wrote
   above:

   And he also prosecuted Klansman Henry Francis Hays, son of Alabama Klan
   leader Bennie Hays, for abducting and killing Michael Donald, a black
   teenager selected at random. Sessions insisted on the death penalty for
   Hays. When he was later elected the state Attorney General, Sessions
   followed through and made sure Hays was executed. The successful
   prosecution of Hays also led to a $7 million civil judgment against the
   Klan, effectively breaking the back of the KKK in Alabama.

   That characterization of Sessions’s involvement in Henry Francis Hays
   was based on this quote from when I interviewed Sessions in 2009: “I
   prosecuted the head of the Klan for murdering somebody, and I insisted
   the klansman be given the death penalty. When I became attorney general
   years later, I handled that appeal and ensured that he was, in fact,
   executed.”

   At the time I wrote this seven years ago, and when I wrote the piece
   Friday, I did not understand this to be Sessions saying he “prosecuted”
   Hays in the narrow sense of the word or that he was trying to take
   credit for the work of the Mobile County district attorney. Hays was
   obviously tried in state court. However, Sessions’s office did a lot of
   initial investigation and legwork on the case, and my understanding was
   that Sessions worked with the DA to make sure that the case got into
   state court specifically for the reason of seeking the death penalty.
   And in fact, [108]a recent CBS News report notes that in Sessions’s
   failed judiciary confirmation hearings in 1986 Sessions testified “he
   had been involved in the decision to try one of the killers in state
   court so he could face the death penalty.” That has not been disputed
   since then, so far as I can tell.

   Sessions later [109]brought up Hays’s accomplice and Hays’s father on
   federal charges related to the murder—a 1985 AP story quotes Sessions
   saying “justice has been done” after his office got a life sentence in
   federal court for Hays’s accomplice James Knowles. Between the
   investigative work and that it appears Sessions was working with the
   state on an overall prosecutorial strategy, I understood Sessions to be
   saying he prosecuted Hays in a broader sense. This would not be
   inaccurate, even if some people were confused that it did not mean that
   as a U.S. attorney Sessions was obviously not the guy who conducted the
   trial in a state court.

   In any event, I would have obviated the criticism had I clarified his
   role here or perhaps said he was “involved in the prosecution” of Henry
   Francis Hays. Regardless, some critics started to get very far afoot
   from what I wrote, by claiming that I said Sessions “led the
   prosecution” of Henry Francis Hays, which is much more emphatic than
   what I wrote or understood to be the case.

   The bottom line: Sessions was instrumental in seeing a Klan murderer
   charged with the death penalty, and later worked as Alabama’s attorney
   general to see that the death sentence was carried out swiftly, making
   Henry Francis Hays the first white man executed in Alabama for
   murdering a black person since 1913. Sessions spent the better part of
   two decades going after the Klan in Alabama, and that should be kept in
   mind when you assess the decades old charges that he is racist.

[116]Iran Using Commercial Planes to Smuggle Weapons to Terrorists

   Posted on [117]November 25, 2016 by [118]admin

Obama admin accused of facilitating Iranian terror by approving new airplane
sales

   From [119]Free Beacon:

     The Obama administration has given clearance to Western airline
     manufacturers to sell planes to Iran at the same time the Islamic
     Republic is using commercial airliners to smuggle weapons and other
     illicit arms to Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon, according to new
     intelligence and congressional communications obtained by the
     Washington Free Beacon.

     The disclosure of this new intelligence, which shows that Iran has
     been using its commercial airline company to smuggle advanced
     weaponry to Hezbollah and terrorists operating in Syria, has placed
     renewed focus on a congressional inquiry that has been stymied by
     Obama administration officials since early October.

     Senators, led by Sen. David Perdue (R., Ga.), have been pushing
     Obama administration officials to explain why they are helping
     airline manufacturers Boeing and AirBus sell planes to Iran, despite
     clear evidence that Tehran is using its commercial airline as cover
     for its continued terrorist operations across the region.

     As with multiple other congressional investigations into the Obama
     administration’s efforts to roll back economic sanctions and conduct
     secret dealings with Iran, officials have stonewalled Perdue,
     refusing to answer key questions about the motivation for aiding
     Tehran’s pursuit of planes that could be used to further its
     terrorist enterprise.

     This new intelligence comes just days after the Obama administration
     approved a second license for AirBus, a French company, to pursue
     even more sales with Iran.

     The Free Beacon recently disclosed that several American-made planes
     are currently being flown by Iran’s Air Force, while other jets are
     being used in its commercial sector to smuggle arms.

     Perdue on Wednesday accused the Obama administration of facilitating
     Iran’s terrorist operations by signing off on the multi-billion
     dollar deals to sell Iran planes, according to a [120]letter sent to
     the Treasury Department, which oversees such sales, and obtained by
     the Free Beacon.

     The senator chided the department for ignoring his initial Oct. 6
     request for information, describing this lack of response as
     “troubling.”

     “While I find your lack of a response to our last letter troubling,
     I would not that the issue surrounding commercial aircraft usage for
     illicit purposes by the Iranian regime has now expanded, given new
     intelligence information alleging that Iran has indeed been using
     Mahan Air — a commercial airline that is currently subject to U.S.
     and UN sanctions — to smuggle weapons and ammunition to Hezbollah in
     Lebanon,” Perdue writes.

     New intelligence unearthed by the Israelis and disseminated to
     United Nations Security Council members in an “urgent letter” shows
     that Iran has been using Mahan Air to smuggle a large quantity of
     arms into Lebanon, where they are then transferred to Hezbollah,
     which remains committed to destroying the Jewish state.

     “These planes fly directly to the airport in Lebanon or Damascus and
     from there the weapons are transferred on the ground to Hezbollah,”
     according to the [121]letter sent by Israeli officials to U.N.
     Security Council members.

     This includes weapons, ammunition, and missile technology to
     Hezbollah, which is placed inside suitcases and placed on Mahan’s
     commercial flights.

     The intelligence further shows that Hezbollah now has about 12,000
     missiles hidden underground in Lebanon, or “more than 17 times the
     number of missiles it possessed 10 years ago, and more than the
     European NATO allies have above the ground,” according to Perdue’s
     letter.

     The intelligence appears to confirm fears by many in Congress that
     the easing of airline sales to Iran by the Obama administration will
     directly fuel Tehran’s global terrorist operation, according to the
     senator.

     “This report confirms precisely the fear we expressed in our October
     6 letter: that Iran continues to use commercial aircraft to smuggle
     weapons and ammunition in violation of UN Security Council
     Resolution 2231 to support its terrorist proxies,” Perdue wrote,
     referring to the UN resolution currently governing last year’s
     comprehensive nuclear deal with Iran.

     “We are rightly concerned that Iran may continue to do so with the
     new commercial aircraft it purchases from Boeing and Airbus, as
     permitted by the U.S. Treasury Department,” the letter stated.

     Despite this intelligence, the Obama administration continues to
     sign off on and endorse these sales to Iran.

     “I was also disturbed to see that Airbus, one of the companies
     seeking licenses for the sale of commercial aircraft to the
     government of Iran, was just awarded a second license from U.S.
     Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) to sell up to 118 jets to
     Iran,” Perdue wrote. “To echo the concerns of our last letter, what,
     if any, end-use monitoring controls can you guarantee will follow
     this license to ensure that these aircraft are not used to further
     support Iran’s terrorist proxies or support for the Assad regime in
     Syria?”

     One senior congressional aide familiar with the matter told the Free
     Beacon that the Obama administration’s permissive attitude towards
     Tehran has only emboldened its bad behavior.

     “The sanctions relief President Obama agreed to has allowed Iran to
     ramp up support for its destructive ambitions,” the source said.
     “Given this recent discovery by [Israeli U.N.] Ambassador Danon,
     President Obama and Congress shouldn’t wait to see what this rogue
     nation has planned for this massive increase in commercial
     aircraft.”

     “It’s been nearly a year since the implementation of President
     Obama’s nuclear deal and we’ve seen Iran become increasingly
     aggressive in its support of terrorism,” the source noted. “In fact,
     Iran is still the number one state sponsor of terrorism. If this
     isn’t a symptom of a failed deal, what is?”

[125]Tim Allen calls out ‘hypocritical’ Hollywood for bullying

   Posted on [126]November 22, 2016 by [127]admin

   Tim Allen stopped by “The Kelly File” to call out those in Hollywood
   who are bullying people who support President-elect Donald Trump.

   “What I find odd in Hollywood is that they didn’t like Trump because he
   was a bully,” Allen told FOX News’ Megyn Kelly on Monday night. “But if
   you had any kind of inkling that you were for Trump, you got bullied
   for doing that. And it gets a little bit hypocritical to me.”

   in good humor’

   The “Last Man Standing” star added that he’s “not a spokesman for
   Hollywood” but rather a comedian who doesn’t “want anyone to tell me
   what to do.”

   “You get bullied into a position, but I don’t want to defend the guy,”
   Allen explained. “To me, he acts like a new talent comedian. These are
   guys that have great material that have very bad comedy timing. And
   he’s got terrible timing.”

   Allen also noted that while his “Last Man Standing” character is
   conservative, the show is “written by liberals.”

   The [130]actor told us in January that he “can be really either left
   leaning or very very right leaning,” but always ends up “center right.”

[136]McDonald’s Deals Blow to Minimum Wage Protesters With Automated Ordering
Machines

   Posted on [137]November 22, 2016 by [138]admin

   Unfortunately for minimum wage activists, it looks like the “[139]fight
   for $15” is about to become the “fight to not have our jobs automated
   out of existence.”

   According to [140]CNN Money, McDonald’s — the nation’s most iconic fast
   food chain — is about to roll out automated ordering kiosks across the
   country at all of its locations, presumably to cut down on labor costs.

   In fact, McDonald’s also plans to introduce mobile ordering, which
   would allow customers to skip the kiosks entirely.

   IFRAME: [141]https://www.youtube.com/embed/34T3IkAtOrc?rel=0&showinfo=0

   “Customers have access to information that gives them much more control
   over their lives,” McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook said.

   While McDonald’s is hailing this as an attempt to give customers “much
   more control over their lives,” the locations it will be rolling out
   first are telling. Five-hundred restaurants in Florida, New York and
   California have the automated machines, and the next targets
   are Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C.

   mcdonalds-kiosk

   [142]New York, [143]Florida, [144]Seattle, [145]Washington D.C.,
   [146]Boston, [147]Los Angeles and [148]San Francisco have already put
   into effect legislation that will raise the minimum wage, some to
   eventually reach the $15 mark. This means that almost every locale
   seeing these kiosks has decided against elementary economics and is
   about to find out exactly how that works for them.

   McDonald’s is [149]far from the only chain doing this, and it’s
   certainly not going to be the last. In fact, in addition to killing
   jobs, these minimum wage laws may also benefit large corporations the
   most.

   While these kiosks save money, few small businesses are going to be
   able to afford the initial investment  in the kind of tech
   development that companies like McDonald’s or Wendy’s are able to.
   They’d likely have to either buy the equipment at a huge markup with
   exorbitant licensing fees for the software, or simply go out of
   business because they can’t compete with the lower labor costs large
   corporations can deliver thanks to economies of scale.

   Way to go, “fight for $15.” You started out trying to turn minimum-wage
   burger-flipping jobs into a living wage. You may end up eliminating
   burger-flipping jobs entirely.
