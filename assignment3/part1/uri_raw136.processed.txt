   Starbucks' brand has taken a beating since the company announced plans
   to hire [27]10,000 refugees worldwide in the next five years in
   response to Donald Trump's executive order intended to prevent refugees
   from entering the US.

   The coffee giant's consumer perception levels have fallen by two-thirds
   since late January, according to YouGov BrandIndex.

   The perception tracker measures if respondents have "heard anything
   about the brand in the last two weeks, through advertising, news or
   word of mouth, was it positive or negative." In Starbucks' case,
   perception is still overall positive, but significantly lower than it
   was prior to CEO Howard Schultz published a public letter outlining the
   company's plans to give refugees jobs.

   "We are living in an unprecedented time, one in which we are witness to
   the conscience of our country, and the promise of the American Dream,
   being called into question," CEO Howard Schultz wrote in a letter to
   Starbucks employees about the plan.

   The graphic below shows YouGov's brand perception since October of last
   year. The red arrow points to when Starbucks announced its plan to hire
   10,000 refugees.

   (YouGov/Business Insider)

   YouGov says that there's reason to believe backlash will impact the
   chain's bottom line. Two days before Starbucks' announcement, 30% of
   consumers said they'd consider buying from Starbucks the next time they
   were craving coffee, the highest proportion in nearly a year. Now, the
   percentage is down to 24%, according to YouGov.

   While many customers were immediately supportive of Starbucks'
   actions to support refugees, others threatened to boycott.

   "Upon hearing about your decision to hire 10000 refugees instead of
   Americans I will no longer spend any money at Starbucks," [28]one such
   Facebook user wrote on Starbucks' page in late January.

   Some of this resentment seemed to be rooted in a belief that Starbucks
   was hiring refugees instead of veterans. Starbucks, however, does have
   a program in place to support veterans and their families, hiring 8,000
   veterans and military spouses since 2014 — an initiative the chain has
   [29]attempted to highlight in recent days and weeks online and on
   social media.
