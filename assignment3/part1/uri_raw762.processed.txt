Patriots Draft Targets: McCaffrey, Peppers, and More

   share on:[33]Facebook[34]Twitter [35]Google +

   Philip Tor | Pats Militia

   Its the offseason, aaaaannnnndddd it kinda sucks watching bowling
   instead of football. What do I have to occupy myself for the next 6
   months until camp opens? Talk about the Patriots obviously. The next
   step for New England is the NFL combine and then NFL draft in May. I
   personally am excited to see the direction Bill Belichick guides the
   team into. This offseason is big for the Pats, bigger than in recent
   years. The Patriots have about a million guys with expiring contracts,
   and don’t have enough money to sign them all. [36]Martellus Bennett has
   already said that he is going to test free agency, and there is a more
   than likely chance that he will go. Guys like Dont’a Hightower, Jabaal
   Sheard, Chris Long, Logan Ryan, Sebastian Vollmer, Duron Harmon, hell
   even Malcolm Butler are all headed for free agency. This years draft is
   critical for New England to stock up on young talent  and build up a
   core just as they did in 2012-13 (Hightower, Collins, Butler, Flowers,
   Brown)

   With that being said, the 4 areas that the Patriots need to target in
   the draft are SS, LB/DE, RB, TE. Here are my top targets for each
   position

Strong Safety:

Jabrill Peppers – SS – Michigan – 6″1 – 205 lbs

   Peppers is an interesting player in this years draft. despite getting
   Heisman trophy votes after a great career at Michigan, many people
   believe Peppers is hyped up. After looking at his numbers from his
   senior year (1 INT, 1 FF, 1 PD, 4 Sacks) i was extremely unimpressed.
   His production lacked on the field, but what makes Peppers so valuable
   is his versatility. Peppers can cover the slot, drop back to safety, or
   even move up to linebacker in different sets. Peppers is not afraid to
   throw his body into a hit, and that man can hit hard. Peppers would
   work great in a Matt Patricia defense that uses many different sets and
   packages. With McCourty and Harmon both turning 30 this year, it would
   be smart to invest in a jack of all trades type player like Peppers for
   the future. Peppers also has value in the return game, as he averages
   27.9 kickoff return yards his senior year. With Cyrus Jones’ status in
   question, Peppers could slide right into that role if he were selected
   by New England. We’ll see where the scouts place Peppers after the
   combine, because with a good showing he could potentially move up in
   the draft to the mid 10’s or 20’s. If he does happen to fall the
   Patriots should not hesitate to grab this kid.

   Running Back:

Christian McCaffrey – RB – Stanford – 6″0 – 202 lbs

   [920x920.jpg?resize=300%2C209] Photo: Michael Macor, The Chronicle

   Just how perfect of a match is McCaffrey and the Patriots? A little too
   perfect if you ask me. The Junior out of Stanford tore it up in
   college. His Junior year he torched the PAC-12 with over 2,000 yards
   rushing with another 645 receiving yards. His numbers dropped off a bit
   in 2016, but he still netted 1,600 yards rushing 310 yards receiving
   and found the end-zone 16 times. I love the fit of McCaffrey and the
   Patriots because of his quickness, ability to catch and run in the open
   field, and his durability (He touched the ball a lot in college and he
   rarely complained of injury or was listed on the injury report). I love
   me some Dion Lewis, but if he cannot stay healthy enough to be on the
   field for at least 13-14 games per season, what is the point. If I
   could grab a guy like Lewis, who is proven to be more durable and have
   more potential upside, than take the shot. I really hope McCaffrey
   slips down to 32 because he is a special talent that the Patriots could
   really take advantage with all the changes they will make by next year.

James Conner – RB – Pittsburgh – 6″2 – 240 lbs

   [conner.jpeg?resize=300%2C200] Gene J. Puskar AP

   If McCaffrey gets taken earlier than 32, which is probably going to
   happen, another good option at RB would be the big man James Conner out
   of Pitt. Even though LeGarrette Blount has said he wants to stay in New
   England, his age, his desired salary, and his production, all beg the
   question: Is it worth it to re-sign him? If that answer becomes a clear
   cut no, than the Patriots would need another power back to push the
   ball between the tackles. This is where Conner is most valuable. His
   large frame helps him burst through the line. He is a great downhill
   runner who protects the ball brilliantly. Conner only had one fumble in
   2016, and 6 in his college career. His best season came as a sophomore
   where he rushed 298 times for over 1700 yards and 26 TDs. According to
   his coaches, Conner is a stand-up guy and a vocal leader in the locker
   room. It’d be interesting to see what kind of impact he could make if
   he does end up in Foxboro. Not to mention the kids obvious mental
   strength and positivity, as Conner was diagnosed with cancer and missed
   nearly all of the 2015 season. Glad to see he is doing better and one
   step towards his dream.

   After watching this video, I really hope the Patriots draft this kid

Edge Rusher:

Takkarist McKinley – DE/OLB – UCLA – 6″2 – 265 lbs

   [r112592_576x324_16-9.jpg?resize=300%2C169] Carrie Jesenovec/Icon
   Sportswire

   McKinley is a BEAST on the edge, plain and simple. The man can bull
   rush the f*** out of the passer. His explosiveness combined with his
   quickness is what made him one of the most feared OLB’s in the country
   last season. With 10 sacks and 3 forced fumbles last year, McKinley
   established himself as a beast on the edge. Experts project McKinley to
   go anywhere from mid first to high second, so if he falls expect the
   Pats to jump on a D-lineman as they have done in the past (Easley 2014,
   Brown 2015).

TJ Watt – OLB – Wisconsin – 6″4 – 243 lbs

   The next Watt brother to jump into the NFL is TJ Watt again out of
   Wisconsin. After battling a number of injuries in his freshman and
   sophomore season, Watt emerged as one of the best OLB’s in the nation
   collecting 11.5 sacks in 14 games. His athleticism and football IQ are
   what the scouts believe will help him excel at the next level. If he is
   anything like his older brother JJ, than he will be sure to make a
   splash early on in his career. I consider TJ to be a very realistic
   pick at no.64, but if he has a good combine and pro-day than he could
   shoot up into the late first round.

Tight Ends:

O.J Howard – TE – Alabama – 6″6 – 242

   With the likelihood that Martellus Bennett is leaving New England, and
   Rob Gronkowski’s injury status in limbo the Patriots have to start
   looking for other options at tight end. The position has been a
   fundamental factor in the Josh McDaniels offense for the past 5 years,
   and in this draft a clear cut replacement is OJ Howard from Alabama.
   Howard is a big body, much like Bennett and Gronk, and makes the
   safeties and LB’s that cover him look puny. Even though he is a big
   body he is super fast. A good comparison that people have been making
   is Jimmy Grahm of the Seahawks. His upside is massive, but the reality
   is the Patriots will have to move up to get him, which Belichick is not
   inclined to do. Howard is a great talent and certainly will be on the
   Patriots radar come combine time.

Bucky Hodges – TE – Virginia Tech – 6″6 – 245 lbs

   Hodges is a lot like Howard. Big, long, athletic body who can make
   defenders look foolish in the passing game. He is a talented deep
   threat, but some experts believe he is simply “an overgrown receiver”.
   Despite those beliefs, Hodges is definitely one of the most targeted
   red
   zone threats in the draft. This was his specialty at Virginia Tech, and
   where he did most of his damage. Hodges would be an interesting pick
   for the Patriots because he is another guy who is weak in the blocking
   area of his game. His production cannot be overlooked either, as he has
   been a consistent factor in the Hokies attack (25 games, 85 Rec, 1056
   Yds, and 13 TDs). I think Hodges would be a great value 3rd round pick
   and be a great replacement for Bennett if he were to leave the
   Patriots.
