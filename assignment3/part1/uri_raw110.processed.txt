   New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick could be called to testify in
   the Aaron Hernandez double murder trial, according to documents
   released Wednesday.

   Belichick is listed among the possible defense witnesses who could be
   called to the stand.

   Hernandez, the former Patriots tight end, is already serving a life
   sentence for the fatal shooting of Odin Lloyd in 2013.

   Belichick was listed on the witness list for that trial but was not
   called to testify. However team owner Robert Kraft was called to the
   stand.

   Hernandez is again standing trial after pleading not guilty to the
   early morning shootings of two men in Boston in 2012.

   The defense lawyers also may call Hernandez’s former teammate at the
   University of Florida, current Miami Dolphins center Mike Pouncey, to
   testify, according to The Boston Globe.

   The Globe also reported previous court filings by the prosecutors show
   they might call Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels to
   testify about one of Hernandez’s tattoos.

   Jury selection in the trial, being held in Boston, continued Wednesday.

   Hernandez played for New England from 2010 to 2012 before being
   released in the wake of his arrest in connection with the Lloyd murder.
