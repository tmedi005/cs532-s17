Patriots To-Do List: Figure out whatâ€™s up with Cyrus Jones

Patriots To-Do List: Figure out whatâ€™s up with Cyrus Jones

   By [36]Tom E. Curran [37]February 22, 2017 12:27 PM
   [38]Chicago Bulls forward Jimmy Butler (left) and Indiana Pacers
   forward Paul George.

[39]Five reasons standing pat may be Celtics' best move

   With the trade deadline near, it's looking as if the Celtics roster
   won't change significantly. Here's why no move may be the best move.

   Personally, I would buy a crapload of stock in Cyrus Jones. In part
   because â€“ after his nightmarish rookie season â€“ stock can be bought on
   the cheap. But also because heâ€™s too talented, too committed and too
   smart to suck like he did in 2016 when he handled punts like they were
   coated in uranium and never made a big contribution in the secondary.

   (Listen above to hear Tom E. Curran and Phil Perry discuss Cyrus Jones
   on the Quick Slants podcast.)

   Because of his disappointing year, Jones is an overlooked player on the
   Patriots roster, but heâ€™s in a pivotal spot. With Logan Ryan and Duron
   Harmon approaching free agency, Malcolm Butlerâ€™s contract expiring
   after 2017, Pat Chung on the edge of 30 and a free agent after 2018 and
   the other corners being Justin Coleman, Eric Rowe and Jonathan Jones,
   Cyrus Jones is going to get his shot.

   The reason I included safeties Harmon and Chung in the discussion is
   that when the Patriots go to six DBs, roles are less stringently
   defined. And because of Jonesâ€™ size (5-10, 200), powerful build and
   short-area quickness, he can be the kind of versatile player who covers
   inside against quicker slot receivers as well as being on the outside
   if necessary. Kind of like Chung can cover on the back end or drop down
   to cover tight ends.

   The Patriots are confident that Jones will get it right. His teammates
   in the secondary are unanimous in saying heâ€™s got all the talent he
   needs.

   PATRIOTS TO-DO LIST:
     * [41]First priority is to get their Gronk right
     * [42]To tag, or not to tag Hightower?
     * [43]Pats shouldn't over-extend for Bennett
     * [44]Franchise tag window open until March 1

   But as 2016 wore on, it was apparent that Jones was miserable and let
   his failures consume him. [45]Jones muffed or fumbled five kicks in the
   2016 season.

   By the time the Patriots played the Ravens on a Monday night in
   December, he was so inside his own head that he stalked a bouncing punt
   he had no business being near (for the second time that game) and had
   it bounce off his foot setting up a Ravens touchdown. That night, Jones
   exited the Patriots locker room and made his way to the players parking
   lot before the field was even clear of equipment.

   Jones either expected things to come as easily in the NFL as they did
   at Alabama and wasnâ€™t prepared to deal with adversity. Or the mistakes
   he made caused him to wonder if he really was good enough to play in
   the league.

   Either way, Cyrus Jones was all about Cyrus Jones in 2016. And[46] his
   comments to the Baltimore Sun over the weekend were evidence that the
   world heâ€™s concerned with ends at the end of his nose.

   "I honestly felt cursed," he said. "I reached a point where I didn't
   even want to play. I just didn't have it...What I did this year was not
   me," he said. "I don't care how anybody tries to sugarcoat it. Yes, I
   was a rookie. But I feel I should always be one of the best players on
   the field, no matter where I am.

   "But honestly, it was hell for me," he said. "That's the only way I can
   describe it. I didn't feel I deserved to be part of anything that was
   happening with the team. I felt embarrassed that these people probably
   thought they wasted a pick on me."

   The first thing Jones needs to do this offseason is get over himself.
   He can look one locker down and talk to Devin McCourty about getting
   crushed for shaky play in 2012, battling through it and then turning
   into a Pro Bowl-level safety. He can talk to fellow Alabama product
   Dont'a Hightower about [47]Hightowerâ€™s being benched in the 2013 season
   against the Broncos and labeled a bust before flipping his season
   around and being the teamâ€™s best defender by the end of that year.

   But heâ€™s going to have to figure it out. Draft status means nothing to
   New England and, as it now stands, undrafted corner Jonathan Jones out
   of Auburn has more demonstrated value to the team that Cyrus Jones
   does. In two months, the Patriots are damn sure going to add more
   secondary players.

   This offseason, Jones needs to check his ego, simplify his game and
   simply ban outside perceptions from fans, media or coaches from infect
   his on-field decision-making.

   His conversation with the Sun didnâ€™t really indicate heâ€™s ready to do
   that. Asked about criticism, Jones said, â€œIt pisses me off. You can say
   shut it out or don't listen, but I know people are talking, and it's
   negative. I'm not a dumb guy. It definitely affects me. What it should
   do is piss me off in a way that I want to shut them all up."

   From the limited number of times I spoke with him and from his
   teammates regard for him, I can confirm Jones isnâ€™t a dumb guy. That
   doesnâ€™t necessarily make life easier though. In 2016, Cyrus Jonesâ€™
   brain got in the way. The Patriots need him to shut that thing off in
   2017.

Bennett to critics: â€˜You take a paycutâ€™

Bennett to critics: â€˜You take a paycutâ€™

   [64]Chicago Bulls forward Jimmy Butler (left) and Indiana Pacers
   forward Paul George.

[65]Five reasons standing pat may be Celtics' best move

   With the trade deadline near, it's looking as if the Celtics roster
   won't change significantly. Here's why no move may be the best move.

   Martellus Bennett is as good at Twitter as he is at football. Add to
   that the fact that all eyes are on whether the free agent will stay in
   New England and the [66]@MartysaurusRex account becomes a must-follow.

   On Wednesday, Bennett put his powers to good use and shared a glimpse
   into his line of thinking regarding free agency.

   Bennett, who could very well leave the Pats for more money, responded
   to a criticism of his desire to get paid and followed it with several
   more musings.

     Everyone trying to guess what another man is thinking and projecting
     that into the world is irresponsible.
     â€” Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) [67]February 22, 2017

     Damn reports are like the people that talk during the movie trying
     to guess who the killer is.
     â€” Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) [68]February 22, 2017

     Ass-umptions.
     â€” Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) [69]February 22, 2017

     And stop @'ing me about taking less money. You take less money and
     your job? All of you take a pay cut hahaha.
     â€” Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) [70]February 22, 2017

     Anyways I love you all. ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤— I hope you all get a raise today or
     tomorrow.
     â€” Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) [71]February 22, 2017

Report: Belichick may be called to testify in Hernandez trial

Report: Belichick may be called to testify in Hernandez trial

   By [80]CSN Staff [81]February 22, 2017 1:00 PM
   [82]Chicago Bulls forward Jimmy Butler (left) and Indiana Pacers
   forward Paul George.

[83]Five reasons standing pat may be Celtics' best move

   With the trade deadline near, it's looking as if the Celtics roster
   won't change significantly. Here's why no move may be the best move.

   Bill Belichick, identified as "William Belichick," has been added to
   the list of potential defense witnesses who could testify during the
   upcoming double-homicide trial of former Patriots tight end Aaron
   Hernandez, [84]according to the Boston Herald.

   Per the Herald, the new list of potential witnesses for the defense
   also includes Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels and
   Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey, who was Hernandez's teammate at the
   University of Florida.

   Belichick, McDaniels and Pouncey aren't guaranteed to testify, but
   their presence on the civilian witness list makes their presence in
   court a possibility.

   Hernandez's trial is scheduled to start next Wednesday. He's accused of
   killing Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu and Safiro Furtado back in July
   of 2012. Hernandez is currently serving a life sentence after being
   convicted of the murder Odin Lloyd in 2013.
