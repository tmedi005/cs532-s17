   It’s been set for months that pop star Lady Gaga will be performing
   during halftime on Sunday’s Super Bowl broadcast (Feb. 5). However,
   several people are hoping that another group of chart-toppers will take
   Mother Monster’s place during the telecast.

   Decided’

   A [31]petition to have the Migos take Lady Gaga’s performance slot has
   made the rounds online, with over 60,000 signatures. The “Bad And
   Boujee” hit-makers, whose album Culture is poised to be number-one on
   the charts, have caught wind of the petition, and are certainly down to
   make an appearance.

   When asked by [32]TMZ’s reporters Wednesday (Feb. 1) about the
   possibility of an appearance during the coveted halftime performance,
   the trio seemed gung-ho about joining the “Million Reasons” songbird,
   of course, if they’re asked by Gaga herself.

   “Ay man, who knows, man. Whenever the phone call [comes],” said Quavo,
   while Offset replied with “Dat way.”

   “We ain’t tryna take Lady Gaga off, we just wanna slide in first real
   quick,” said Takeoff. “Let us get in there.”

   When another TMZ reporter asked if anyone from the NFL or Gaga’s team
   has reached out to them, Quavo started plugging the Culture
   album, jumping around the question entirely and neither confirming nor
   denying any news.

   It would be fitting indeed to have the Georgia natives make an
   appearance, as the Atlanta Falcons are one of the teams playing for a
   Super Bowl ring (against the New England Patriots).

   The Super Bowl

   “Halftime should be Migos killing Bad and Boujee, Future kills em with
   March Madness, then Outkast comes out and does an AQUEMINI sampler and
   then they end it with BUN B and JAY Z DOING BIG PIMPIN!!!!” reads the
   petition. “If you’re gonna put on a show for billions THIS IS THE ONLY
   SHOW.”
