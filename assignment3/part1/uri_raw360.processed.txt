   Associated Press

   EXCLUSIVE: A new book and feature film project about [46]Tom Brady, who
   has won more Super Bowls than any quarterback in [47]NFL history, is on
   its way. [48]Paul Tamasy and [49]Eric Johnson, the writers behind
   Disney‚Äôs The Finest Hours who were nominated for an Oscar for The
   Fighter, and New York Times bestselling author [50]Casey Sherman are
   reteaming.

   Joining up with them is Boston journalist [53]Dave Wedge, who was
   Sherman‚Äôs co-author on Boston Strong. Tamasy and Johnson used the book
   as part of their source material the basis for Patriots Day, which they
   got story by credit on and also executive produced.

   [54]Tom Brady movie

   The Brady book and film will chronicle the [55]New England Patriots
   superstar‚Äôs come-from-behind win in Super Bowl LI, but it‚Äôs not going
   to shy away from controversy and will include the team‚Äôs battle to
   overcome the Deflategate debacle in 2014, follow Brady‚Äôs fall from
   grace and then his triumphant return to lead the Patriots to his fifth
   world championship. That surprising overtime victory against the
   Falcons this month cemented Brady‚Äôs and Bill Belichick‚Äôs legacies as
   the top quarterback and head coach in NFL history.

   The writers already have cultivated several sources inside the Patriots
   locker room to provide a first-hand look at what went on behind the
   scenes in a Super Bowl that had everyone on the edge of their seats.
   The game, which the Patriots won 34-28, drew comparisons to other
   iconic moments in sports history such as Muhammad Ali‚Äôs win over George
   Foreman in the 1974 ‚ÄúRumble in the Jungle.‚Äù

   Tamasy and Johnson also recently penned [56]the screenplay about
   5,000-to-1 underdog Leicester City‚Äôs miraculous run to the English
   Premier League title. We‚Äôre told that Sherman and Wedge (who both work
   in Boston) had a front-row seat and watched the drama unfold.

   Sherman‚Äôs book The Finest Hours, which Tamasy and Johnson adapted, was
   made into a film last year that starred Chris Pine and Casey Affleck,
   the latter a Best Actor Oscar nominee for Manchester By The Sea.

   The writers are repped by WME and The Gotham Group.

       Awful idea. Unless they get Brady to play himself. Then it‚Äôs worth

       Who is paying to see a fake actor pretending to see Tom Brady when
       we have the real thing for free on television? We also know the
       outcome of this story. And it just happened. These are good writers
       but this will tank and they‚Äôll never get the NFL Logos unless they
       give the NFL approval over their script.

            Agree. NFL will be looking at this much differently over brand
            permissions and chain of title / insurances would be
            interesting for errors & omissions coverages.
            Great final game, but the game like a reality show is over.

       I think its a great idea‚Ä¶but AFTER he retires. This man is so
       freaking ridiculously good at his craft that they are making a

       Any book about Brady should be post retirement and be all
       inclusive. Tell all? Well, that depends on motive. Clear his name?
       Or revenge.Be classy and always ask the question, ‚Äù what can be
       gained?
