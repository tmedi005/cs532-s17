In a Night of Super Bowl Firsts, Fox Reaps Bonus Windfall With Overtime Ads

   It was a game that largely confounded expectations, a dazzling,
   dizzying spectacle that served as a microcosm of sorts for the
   [140]entire NFL season while upending a half-century of precedent. Tom
   Brady and his infuriatingly consistent New England Patriots on Sunday
   night put together the single greatest comeback in Super Bowl history,
   and in so doing made a complete hash of the record books. That it took
   a few minutes of overtime for the Pats to secure their victory was
   simply the icing on a very rich cake for Fox.

   Brady's two-point conversion pass to wideout Danny Amendola knotted the
   score at 28-all with just a minute left in regulation, and Atlanta's
   subsequent failure to advance the ball out of its own territory sent
   the Super Bowl into overtime for the first time in 51 years. Because ad
   sales are about managing contingencies, Fox had pre-sold a number of
   bonus spots on the odd chance that [141]Super Bowl LI would require a
   little temporal wiggle room, and as that prospect became a reality,
   other brands began making inquiries of their own.

   "We always have overtime agreements in place, and did so this year,"
   Fox Networks Group Exec VP-Ad Sales [142]Bruce Lefkowitz told
   Advertising Age a few hours after the game had wrapped. "We were also
   garnering commitments in real time. We would have liked the greatest
   Super Bowl in history to go on forever, and were prepared if it did."

   Because it only took the Pats nine plays to find the end zone, Fox only
   had the chance to air four ads in overtime. In a pod that aired between
   the coin toss and Matt Bosher's kickoff, the network reprised the
   [143]Hulu spot for [144]"The Handmaid's Tale" that first ran in the
   second quarter and then followed that trailer with the Sprint
   commercial about the [145]dad who fakes his own death via vehicular
   freefall in order to get out of his [146]Verizon contract. Like the
   Hulu teaser, the Sprint spot also first appeared during the second
   quarter.

   Two original ads closed out the overtime pod; [147]Olivia Munn appeared
   in a 60-second spot for Proactiv, and the student loan refinancing
   company SoFi bought a 30-second sliver of airtime. According to Nielsen
   preliminary metered market data, the four OT spots aired as 74% of all
   TVs in use were tuned to Fox.

   All told, Fox's OT pod sprinkled between $16 million and $20 million in
   additional cash on top of what was already a $400 million-plus night.
   (According to [148]Comcast, at an average rate of $4.5 million per
   30-second spot, NBC in 2015 booked $376 million in Super Bowl XLIX ad
   revenue. CBS, which did not break out its financials for Super Bowl 50,
   took in around $4.8 million per spot a year ago, while Fox's going rate
   for last night's showcase hovered around $5 million per :30.)

   "Overtime generated incremental revenue as a fitting exclamation point
   to the highest revenue day in Fox history," Mr. Lefkowitz said.

   Final live-plus-same-day ratings for Super Bowl LI will be released
   later this afternoon. Given the unprecedented nature of the Patriots'
   victory and the beefed-up preliminary deliveries, it's expected that
   Fox will top the ratings record NBC set two years ago, when New
   England's unlikely win over Seattle averaged [149]114.4 million
   viewers.

   Fox of late has had extraordinary luck with its top-tier sports
   franchises. In October, the Chicago Cubs emerged from a 108-year wallow
   in the doldrums as they rallied from a three-games-to-one deficit to
   beat the Cleveland Indians in the World Series. The Cubbies'
   extra-innings victory in Game 7 delivered 40 million viewers, making it
   the [150]most-watched baseball game in 25 years. According to iSpot.tv
   estimates, the deciding game alone generated nearly $50 million in ad
   revenue.

   While Fox won't host another Super Bowl until 2020, the network has
   another monster sporting event in its sights as it begins to prep for
   its very first production of the FIFA World Cup. The international
   soccer tournament is scheduled to take place in Russia from June 14 to
   July 15, 2018.
