5 unexpected benefits of drinking you never knew

   We’ve all heard it: Drink in moderation or else you’ll do more harm
   than good.

   That’s because while research suggests small amounts of booze can be
   good for us, drinking in excess can harm our heart, brain and
   waistline. According to the American Heart Association, those health
   perks cap out at one drink per day for women and two daily for men.

   [39]WHAT YOUR PAST HABITS MAY MEAN FOR YOUR FUTURE HEALTH

   Indeed, if you’re not a drinker, the potential benefits alone aren’t
   reason enough to start, Dr. Michael Levy, a Massachusetts-based
   clinical psychologist and author of “Take Control of Your Drinking…and
   You May Not Need to Quit,” told Fox News. If you’re drinking more than
   what’s recommended, consider scaling back, Levy recommended.

   That said, you can still feel good about enjoying a glass or two of
   your happy-hour beverage of choice. Here's why:

   Wine
   What it may be good for: Your brain
   Being a light-to-moderate tippler is associated with a reduced risk of
   dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (particularly for people who don’t
   have the gene that makes you more prone to Alzheimer’s), per a 2012
   research review published in the International Journal of Geriatric
   Psychiatry. Researchers noted that wine — which is packed with
   anti-inflammatory antioxidant polyphenols — seems to offer the best
   protection out of all types of booze.

   Beer
   What it may be good for: Your bones
   Brewski is a rich source of silicon, a mineral that plays an important
   role in bone formation, a 2010 study in the Journal of Science and Food
   Agriculture suggests. Dietary sources like beer (cereal and green beans
   are others) may help maintain bone strength, a 2013 study published in
   the International Journal of Endocrinology on postmenopausal women
   notes. However, heavy drinking of any alcohol is linked to
   osteoporosis, so in this case, more is definitely not better.

   Vodka
   What it may be good for: Your heart
   Vino gets all the attention for its disease-busting polyphenols, but
   it’s the ethanol (alcohol) that does half the work, 2012 research in
   the journal Nutrients suggests. Ethanol helps keep blood platelets from
   sticking together (and potentially clotting) and increases “good” HDL
   cholesterol levels, according to the research.

   Whiskey
   What it may be good for: Your mood
   There’s no doubt that a little alcohol can help you let go of stress.
   “It puts you in a different head space,” Levy said. Yet, alcohol
   depresses your central nervous system, and heavier drinking clearly
   increases depression risk, he noted. If a single-finger pour of your
   favorite whiskey helps you unwind at night, that’s OK, but too much may
   lead to mood problems — not exactly the fix you were looking for.

   Champagne
   What it may be good for: Your social bonds
   Time for a toast! Social drinkers tend to be richer in the friend
   department, likely because alcohol triggers the release of endorphins,
   2016 research from Adaptive Human Behavior and Physiology reveals. And
   a group of pals provides a strong source of emotional support. Cheers!
