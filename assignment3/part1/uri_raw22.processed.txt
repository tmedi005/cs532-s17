[23]Americans Suffering From Trump-Related Mental Illness

   Mental health professionals say their offices have been filled with
   patients who are depressed, anxiety-ridden, and stressed out over the
   results of the 2016 election. According to a CNN report this week,
   psychiatrists are beginning to term this new malady “post-election
   stress disorder.”

   While there’s an undeniably funny side to this, some people think it’s
   disrespectful to the suffering many war veterans are going through on a
   daily basis. U.S. Rep Brian Mast, an Army vet who lost his legs to an
   IED in Afghanistan, says it’s a mistake to trivialize something as
   serious as post-traumatic stress disorder.

   “There was a big missed opportunity in naming it ‘Post-Election Stress
   Disorder,'” he said on Fox News Tuesday. “I would have preferred they
   name it ‘Post-Inauguration Stress Disorder,’ that way they could have
   called it ‘PISD.’

   “There’s a big difference between being pissed off about things and
   what happens on the battlefield,” he said.

   Mast said that while he understood that liberals were probably feeling
   irritated about Donald Trump’s election, psychology experts should
   emphasize the difference between what they’re going through and the
   crippling pain of PTSD.

   “I have empathy for the stress in people’s lives in the election,” Mast
   said. “But that does not mean their stress has any real comparison to
   service members who have been targeted by snipers or blown up — who
   have taken the lives of their enemies or had their uniforms stained by
   the blood of their friends — or who have had to bury friends year after
   year after year. There’s not a comparison here.”

   Obviously.

   We have to question whether this supposed mental health crisis is even
   real. Sure, CNN can find one or two psychiatrists willing to back up
   their claim. They can round up a couple of liberals who will be happy
   to tell them how much they’re suffering in the wake of Trump’s
   inauguration. But are we really to believe that a significant number of
   people across the country are so cut off from reality that President
   Trump is responsible for their mental health deterioration?

   Maybe, but the more likely explanation is that the lying media has
   found yet another fake news narrative with which to make Trump look
   bad.

   The sick part about it is that millions of liberals who felt just fine
   will read this and start thinking, “Yeah…yeah, come to think of it, I
   AM depressed! Cool, I have a new identity. I have a new ‘illness’ to
   blame for my crappy life situation!”

   You think any of these psychiatrists ever say, “Turn off your friggin
   Facebook for a day or two…?”
