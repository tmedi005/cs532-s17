   BOSTON (AP) - The value of Tom Brady's missing Super Bowl jersey is
   listed as $500,000 on a Houston Police Department report.


   [51]Hey @edelman11 "Ya suspect, yeah you! I don't know what your
   reputation is in this town, but after that s@?# you pulled, you can bet
   l'll be looking into you!"

   A post shared by Tom Brady (@tombrady) on
   Feb 22, 2017 at 8:39am PST

   The New England Patriots quarterback is listed as the complainant in
   the report dated Feb. 6, the day after the Patriots came back from a
   25-point deficit to defeat the Atlanta Falcons 34-28 in overtime. The
   police report was made public Tuesday.

   Investigators have been working to identify who was in the locker room
   at the time the jersey was taken. A Houston police officer was
   stationed outside the locker room on the day of the game, but access to
   the location was controlled by Patriots team security.

   The Texas Rangers, the state's top law enforcement officers, were
   assisting in the investigation along with the NFL's security
   department.
