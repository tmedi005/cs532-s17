Our Hero Trey Gowdy Just Did The Most AMAZING Thing Ever – Patriots How Proud
Of Him Are You?

   Over the past few years, and certainly recently, Republican Congressman
   Trey Gowdy has emerged as one of the most influential and impactful
   lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

   Gowdy has been racking up one accolade after another for his brave wrk
   fighting corruption, most notably leading the investigation into
   Benghazi that uncovered Hillary Clinton’s email scandal and sullied her
   reputation past the point of no return. You’ll be thrilled to hear that
   Gowdy was just rewarded with his biggest honor yet.

   According to reports, out of all the political figures in the United
   States, Congressman Gowdy was just selected to deliver the prestigious
   annual Winthrop Paul Rockefeller Distinguished Lecture Series at the
   U.S. Marshals Museum.

   Stated Lisenne Rockefeller, who is part of the Rockefeller family
   underwriting the lecture, “We were overwhelmed by the positive feedback
   we received from the inaugural Winthrop Paul Rockefeller Distinguished
   Lecture Series. We are looking forward to continuing this national
   lecture series in my late husband’s honor with Congressman Trey Gowdy
   of South Carolina.”

   The previous Rockefeller Lecture Series chose the late Supreme Court
   Justice Antonin Scalia to deliver the speech, in what proved to be one
   of his final public events. Do you think that Trey Gowdy is a worthy
   successor to Scalia in receiving this great honor?
