   Marvel's 6 Biggest Villains

‘Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2’ Had The Best Super Bowl Trailer Simply By
Looking Fun

   MARVEL

   [92]Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 looks like a [93]deeply silly movie.

   I mean, check out the photo above. There’s a Smurf with a mohawk, a
   bald-headed woman, Andy Dwyer, a green lady, a human-mantis, the winner
   of the 2005 Royal Rumble, a talking raccoon, and a baby tree. The
   characters and even the premise — a bunch of space weirdos fight bad
   guys — are inherently ridiculous, and writer and director James Gunn
   knows this. That’s why he packed Guardians of the Galaxy with
   honest-to-goodness jokes; the climax even involved an extended dance
   sequence. That’s in stark contrast to most of DC’s mope-fests,
   including Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, with
   self-serious scripts written by 16-year-old Hot Topic employees.

   Unfortunately, even though DC refused to drop $5 million to promote
   Wonder Woman or Justice League, all that downbeat brooding was
   everywhere during the Super Bowl movie trailers on Sunday night. It was
   in [94]Transformers: The Last Knight, a film about robots kicking the
   crap out of each other, and [95]Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell
   No Tales, the fifth installment in a series based on a theme park ride,
   and [96]Logan, in which a beer-drinking mutant befriends a young girl.
   Even [97]The Fate of the Furious — the poster-franchise for absurdly
   over-the-top fun — takes half the teaser to drop its first corny
   wisecrack. These trailers downplayed the innate absurdity of the
   movies, and acted like deeply serious art films. Call a spade a spade,
   and [98]a dragon a dragon.

   Take the worst offender, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No
   Tales. First off, there’s no one on Earth who can name every Pirates
   movie, in order, with the correct lengthy subtitle. It’s even more
   confusing than the Twilight or Harry Potter series. Anyway, the trailer
   also strips away everything people liked about the first Pirates movie,
   namely the goofy misadventures of Captain Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp’s
   makeup-heavy shtick has gotten old and irritating, but at the time of
   The Curse of the Black Pearl‘s release, he was praised for his Keith
   Richard-inspired performance. “Consider how boring it would have been
   if Depp had played the role straight,” [99]Roger Ebert wrote. “To take
   this material seriously would make it unbearable. Capt. Sparrow’s
   behavior is so rococo that other members of the cast actually comment
   on it. And yet because it is consistent and because you can never catch
   Depp making fun of the character, it rises to a kind of cockamamie
   sincerity.”

            Probably so they can make a figure of it. Have to think of
            1000 ways to market.

       There’s loads to love about the Guardians universe but my absolute
       favourite thing is Yondu’s whistle controlled arrow/knife missile.
