   [4]Patriots Golf Spotlight : Ben Kendrick
   Men's Golf - Wed, Feb. 22, 2017 at 3:05 PM

   Williamsburg, Ky. - [5]Ben Kendrick (JR/Danville, KY) is a junior
   biology/pre-med major from Danville, Ky.  This fall Kendrick won the
   Bill Sergent Invite shooting a two-day score of 144, and had four other
   top 10 finishes.  He also earned MSC All- Conference Honors and MSC
   All- Academic Honors last season.

   Kendrick came to UC because he wanted to go to an established program
   where he could win while being surrounded by great players and coaches
   that would make him a better player.  His favorite class at UC is
   Physics 1 and his favorite professors are Dr. Tan and Dr. Dzugan.

   His favorite golfer is Rory McIlroy, though his dream foursome would be
   his dad, granddad, and his roommate [6]Ross Perry (JR/Somerset, KY) at
   Danville Country Club.  As far as favorite non-golfer athlete Kendrick
   says it's Roger Federer.

   Kendrick's favorite memory at UC is winning the MSC conference
   championship last season.  His favorite thing to do on campus is eat
   buffalo chicken wraps from the grill.

   When he is not playing golf Kendrick likes to play ping-pong, play
   basketball, to workout and to read. You can also catch him watching his
   favorite movies Good Will Hunting, Star Wars, or Harry Potter, or
   watching his favorite TV Show M.A.S.H

   You can follow Kendrick on Twitter (@bendrick18) and Instagram
