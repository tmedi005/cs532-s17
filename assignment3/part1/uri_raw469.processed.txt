   With the offseason comes the inevitable list of free agents in the NFL.
   For the New England Patriots, among the players up for free agency
   includes LeGarrette Blount.

     __________________________________________________________________

   LeGarrette Blount has made a name for himself in New England as the
   power running back of the New England Patriots. Blount has become a
   valued member of the Patriots’ running back core alongside alternative
   backs Dion Lewis and Super Bowl hero James White.

   Compared to the other two backs, LeGarrette Blount has a very distinct
   running style. Most notably from Blount comes his “Blount Force Trauma”
   style of running. What does this mean exactly? Well, think of Mr.
   Blount as a bit of a battering ram and the defense as the opposing
   wall. Over and over again, Blount hits the defense making progress and
   breaking down his opponents. Some runs are greater than others but one
   fact is for sure, tackling LeGarrette Blount is no easy task.

   Blount had one of his best seasons as a New England Patriot this past
   season. The power back had [98]18 rushing touchdowns breaking the New
   England Patriots’ franchise record for touchdowns on the ground in a
   season.

   LeGarrette Blount has had a good career as a New England Patriot and if
   he has his way, Blount will be back with the Patriots next season.

   [99]According to Blount, “I love it there. I love the culture. I love
   the players. I’ve become close with a lot of the guys. Obviously, you
   know how my running back group is. But we’ll cross that bridge whenever
   we cross it.”

   Hopefully, if a deal can be made, LeGarrette Blount will be wearing a
   New England Patriots’ jersey next season.
