   How to Make Bacon Guacamole Deviled Eggs: Yes, They Taste as Good as
   They Look!)

   Bacon and guacamole deviled eggs? Yes, you read right. What's not to
   love?

   You'll need:
     * 6 hard-boiled eggs
     * 1 large avocado, mashed
     * 2 strips bacon, cooked and crumbled
     * 1 tablespoon minced jalapeno
     * 1 tablespoon minced red onion
     * 1 tablespoon minced cilantro
     * juice of half a lime
     * salt and pepper, to taste

   Here’s how to make them:
     * Cut the eggs in half and scoop the yolks out into a bowl.
     * Mash the yolks with a fork.
     * Add the remaining ingredients and mix well.
     * Stuff the filling back into the egg white halves.

   I don't really measure the red onion, jalapeno and cilantro. Just throw
   it in until it makes me happy. Hope everyone enjoys these as much as we
   do! You can fancy them up by sprnking with more crumbled bacon and/or
   cilantro leaves.
