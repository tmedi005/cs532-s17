   Feb. 22 (UPI) -- It's an abnormal offseason for the [49]New England
   Patriots when one player is headed to jail and coaches might testify in
   a double-murder trial.

   [50]Bill Belichick and [51]Josh McDaniels could be involved in
   [52]Aaron Hernandez's double murder case, [53]according to the Boston
   Globe. Wide receiver Michael Floyd was recently [54]sentenced to four
   months in jail for a December DUI.

   The former Patriots tight end pleaded not guilty to shooting and
   killing two men in 2012. He is already serving a life sentence for
   killing Odin Lloyd in 2013.

   Patriots owner [55]Robert Kraft testified in the Lloyd trial, while
   Belichick was also on the witness list.

   During his testimony, Kraft told the judge that Hernandez [56]told him
   he was innocent.

   Hernandez, 27, is charged with killing Daniel de Abreu and Safiro
   Furtado in 2012. The duo was killed in an alleged drive-by shooting.

   Opening statements for the case are set for March 1. Hernandez played
   in 38 games for the Patriots, before being released.
