LOOK: NFLPA salary cap chart shows Patriots are money smart, Eagles aren't

   Is your favorite NFL team being smart with its money?

   Thanks to the [97]NFL Players Association, we can now kind of answer
   that question. For the past four years, the NFLPA has been tracking how
   much each team has been using in cash.

   Basically, when the new CBA was implemented in 2011, one of the new
   agreements called for each [98]NFL team to spend at least 89 percent of
   its salary cap in cash during specific four-year periods.

   With the first four-year period (2013 to 2016) set to end in March
   2017, the NFLPA released new numbers on Monday that show how each team
   has done in regard to meeting the 89 percent minimum threshold.

   For the four-year period, each team had a total of $554,550,000 in
   salary cap space. Of that total, the CBA required that each had to
   spend roughly $493.5 million in cash on player salaries.

     NFL clubs are required to spend 89% of the cap in cash during a
     4-year period. Here is how every team stacks up, per our updated
     numbers. [99]pic.twitter.com/FI7Gf2I3OA
     — NFLPA (@NFLPA) [100]December 5, 2016

   With just three months to go, the Oakland Raiders are the only team in
   the NFL that hasn't met the minimum spending threshold. At $491.4
   million, the Raiders have roughly 90 days to spend $2.1 million and
   meet the minimum requirement. The Raiders could do that simply by
   extending someone's contract.

   As CBS Sports NFL Insider Jason La Canfora [101]noted in November, if
   the Raiders don't meet the spending threshold, they'd have to cut a
   check to the NFLPA for the amount that they fall short.

   The NFLPA's numbers show that the 32 teams combined to spend a total of
   $17.44 billion in cash on player salary between 2013 and 2016. If you
   want to know if you're team has been spending smartly, just check out
   the rankings below.

   For instance, the Philadelphia Eagles spent more than $600 million
   between 2013 and 2016, but they only have one playoff berth to show for
   that. That's pretty rough, especially when you consider that they're
   the only team that's spent over $600 million. The three teams right
   below the Eagles have all been to the playoffs in each of the past
   three years.

   On the other hand, the Carolina Panthers only spent $495.1 million
   during that span and have three playoff appearances and a [102]Super
   Bowl berth to show for it. Besides the Raiders, the Panthers are the
   only team that spent under $500 million.

   The New England Patriots have also been thrifty, ranking 30th in money
   spent.

   Here's how much each team spent in cash on player salaries between 2013
   and 2016.
    1. Eagles: $613.9 million
    2. Denver Broncos : $587.7 million
    3. Seattle Seahawks : $584.3 million

   10. Baltimore Ravens : $562.4 million
   11. San Diego Chargers : $562.2 million
   12. Indianapolis Colts : $556.3 million
