   Tom Brady’s got a long list of suspects for his stolen jersey, which
   was [22]valued at around $500,000. While that’s serious money, Brady’s
   suspect list was not particularly serious.

   Brady [23]posted the list to Facebook on Wednesday.

   Brady included ring-lovers Julian Edelman and Gollum from the book and
   movie series Lord of the Rings. Brady’s court sketch from the
   Deflategate hearing somehow made its way onto the board. The list also
   includes Jaws, Brady’s dog Scooby and Lady Gaga, among others.

   “Hey [24]Edelman ‘Ya suspect, yeah you! I don’t know what your
   reputation is in this town, but after that s@?# you pulled, you can bet
   l’ll be looking into you!'” Brady wrote.
