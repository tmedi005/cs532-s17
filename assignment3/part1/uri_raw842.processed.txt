Oscar Voter Reveals Her Brutally Honest Ballot: Meryl Streep "Like a Clown,"
'La La Land' "Not Memorable," 'Arrival' "Just Sucked"

   5:02 PM 2/21/2017

   by Anonymous, as told to Scott Feinberg

An Academy voter makes her case for 'Hell or High Water' ("It will be
remembered as a true American classic"), says Emma Stone wasn't "as wonderful
as people are saying," and explains why Viola Davis is in the wrong category
("That really irks me").

   Illustration by Kyle Metcalf

   Each year around this time, I sit down with several Oscar voters who,
   under the warm cloak of anonymity, spill their true feelings about the
   current season's crop of contenders.

   Not just what or whom they voted for, but exactly why and how they came
   to those decisions. It's not meant to be a scientific survey; it's just
   the candid, unsugarcoated opinions of a handful of members (out of
   6,687) of the most important and powerful movie club in the world.

   Below is an edited transcript of one such conversation, Brutally Honest
   Oscar Ballot #1, with a longtime female member of the 1,158-member
   actors branch who — this season, anyway — is not associated with any of
   the nominees.

   More: [32]Brutally Honest Oscar Ballot #2.

     * Best Picture
    Lorey Sebastian
       I hated Arrival — it just sucked. I didn't like Fences because they
       just filmed the play — I wanted to see the guy go into the jazz
       club and play his music, the girl who's having his baby, his kid on
       the football field. But I think Denzel [Washington, its
       producer/director/star] decided that every word of the script [by
       the late August Wilson] was so precious that he wasn't going to
       "mess" with it, and the movie suffered as a result. I loved the
       first half of Lion, but I felt like a different director and
       cinematographer made the second half. I thought Hidden Figures was
       wonderful — because it's a great story, not because it was
       especially hard to tell. It's almost like a glorified Movie of the
       Week. Moonlight and Hacksaw Ridge were really very good, but I
       don't think of them as a best picture. La La Land was tremendously
       enjoyable, but not all that deep or memorable. That left me
       with Manchester by the Sea and Hell or High Water, two
       compassionate movies that were incredibly well written, directed
       and acted. Hell or High Water isn't going to win, but it was my
       favorite, and it will be remembered as a true American classic.
       My vote
       (1) Hell or High Water
       (2) Manchester by the Sea
       (3) La La Land
       (4) Hacksaw Ridge
       (5) Moonlight
     * Best Director
    Claire Folger/Courtesy of Amazon Studios and Roadside Attractions
       Forget about Arrival [director Denis Villeneuve]. After that, it
       was tough. I decided not to go with Hacksaw Ridge, and not because
       of anything to do with Mel Gibson's personal problems — even though
       I'm Jewish. I think he's a different person now; he's a very
       talented director, and I wish him well. [Moonlight's] Barry Jenkins
       did a really good job, but the movie's three parts aren't as
       connected as they could have been. That left me
       with Manchester [Kenneth Lonergan] and La La
       Land [Damien Chazelle]. Damien is such a sweetheart; I loved what
       he did with Whiplash and this one, and he's probably going to win.
       But I voted for Lonergan, because it was harder to make everything
       click on that movie, and he really succeeded.
       My vote
       Kenneth Lonergan (Manchester by the Sea)
     * Best Actor
    Courtesy of Cannes Film Festival
       Denzel has played this role a million times before, and he got the
       Tony for it — I'm sure he was amazing onstage, but he didn't do
       anything unexpected on film. You've got to seem alive in the
       moment, and maybe if he'd gotten a really great director to direct
       him, that person would have nudged him to do that. [Hacksaw's]
       Andrew Garfield and [La La Land's] Ryan Gosling were very good, but
       not Oscar-level. [Manchester's] Casey Affleck had a role worthy of
       his brave acting, and he was absolutely wonderful. But I loved,
       loved, loved Viggo Mortensen's performance [in Captain Fantastic].
       He is an actors' actor, and I voted for him. Unfortunately, it's
       probably the only vote he'll get.
       My vote
       Viggo Mortensen (Captain Fantastic)
     * Best Actress
    Ben Rothstein/FOCUS FEATURES
       I liked none of them. I thought Meryl [Streep in Florence Foster
       Jenkins] played it like a clown — she's cute and adorable, but this
       woman didn't matter to me in the end — but people are gaga over
       Meryl, and I think she solidified her nomination when she gave that
       speech at the Golden Globes. I don't think she would have gotten
       nominated without it. I hated Jackie so much — it was just shallow
       crap — so no Natalie Portman. [Elle's] Isabelle Huppert is an
       ice-cold actress, and I eliminated her because when you get
       attacked, beaten and raped, you're not the same person afterward,
       but she was, and I wanted to slap her to try to get a reaction out
       of her. The girl in La La Land [Emma Stone] is going to win because
       she's adorable and everybody loves her, but I don't think she was
       as wonderful as people are saying. That leaves me with
       Ruth Negga for Loving, who was fairly one-note, but engaging
       enough.
       My vote
       Ruth Negga (Loving)
     * Best Supporting Actor
    CBS Films
       I thought [Lion's] Dev Patel and the kid from Manchester [Lucas
       Hedges] were really good, but not great. The guy
       from Moonlight [Mahershala Ali] was good, but I don't think his
       character was that developed — I mean, he's this great guy, and
       then all of a sudden he just disappears. I really liked Michael
       Shannon in a movie that I didn't like [Nocturnal Animals] — in
       fact, I voted to nominate him. But my heart is with Jeff Bridges,
       because I loved [Hell or High Water]. The acting was sheer
       perfection. Jeff makes it look easy but, boy, what he does is not
       easy.
       My vote
       Jeff Bridges (Hell or High Water)
     * Best Supporting Actress
    Courtesy of TIFF
       I immediately ruled out [Fences'] Viola Davis — don't get me wrong,
       I love her and I think she's wonderful, but that's my protest vote.
       She should have been in the lead actress category, and when the
       studios put these actresses who are clearly the lead in the
       supporting category — like they did with [The Danish Girl's]
       Alicia Vikander last year, even though she had more lines than the
       guy [Eddie Redmayne] — that really irks me. Because it prevents
       real supporting actresses, like the waitress in Hell or High
       Water [Margaret Bowman], from getting nominated. Viola will
       probably win, but she belonged in the leading lady category. I love
       [Hidden Figures'] Octavia Spencer, but I felt the other two women
       in the film [Taraji P. Henson and Janelle Monae] were better.
       Nicole [Kidman in Lion] wasn't all that different from everything
       else I've seen her do. So, for me, it was between Michelle
       [Williams for Manchester], for a true supporting part, and the gal
       from Moonlight [Naomie Harris]. Both of them were wonderful, but
       the gal from Moonlight went to places that were harder to go to.
       My vote
       Naomie Harris (Moonlight)
     * Best Adapted Screenplay
    Courtesy of A24
       As you know, I hated Arrival. The Lion script was uneven. I didn't
       really consider Fences because I don't think it was adapted. So it
       came down to Moonlight and Hidden Figures, and I just thought the
       story of Moonlight was more of a challenge to tell.
       My vote
       Moonlight
     * Best Original Screenplay
    Courtesy of Lorey Sebastian/CBS Films
       20th Century Women was cute, but it didn't fully work. The Lobster
       was interesting but a little bit weird for me. La La Land was very
       light. So I was torn between Manchester and Hell or High Water.
       [Manchester's] Lonergan is very bright and wrote a brilliant
       screenplay, but I have to go with Hell or High Water, even though
       it doesn't have a chance of winning.
       My vote
       Hell or High Water
     * Best Animated Feature
    Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics
       I watched them all and liked several of them, but I loved The Red
       Turtle, which was the most profound of the group.
       My vote
       The Red Turtle
     * Best Documentary Feature
    Courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment
       I'm ruling out O.J. [Made in America] even though I still have an
       hour of it left to watch — maybe for younger people this is new
       stuff, but for me it's just reliving a part of the past I don't
       need to relive. I was disappointed with I Am Not Your Negro — I was
       really looking forward to learning more about James Baldwin's life,
       rather than his ideas (which I already knew), because when I first
       came to New York as a young actress, he was such
       an avant-garde playwright and fascinating guy. Three-quarters of
       Ava DuVernay's movie [13th] was wonderful, but the last quarter was
       so preachy that I felt like I was hit over the head, which was a
       turnoff. They did a really good job with Fire at Sea, except I
       hated that little kid in it — killing birds and cutting up cacti
       and all of that. I voted for Life, Animated because I thought it
       was a positive story, how the parents took a massive challenge and
       made something of it.
       My vote
       Life, Animated
     * Best Foreign-Language Film
    Courtesy of Music Box Films
       I hated the German movie [Toni Erdmann] so much because it was so
       shticky — Germans are not funny! The only part of the whole movie
       where I laughed was when she couldn't get out of her tight dress
       and just ripped it off and went around naked. I hear Jack Nicholson
       is going to be in a remake, and he might make it funny. The other
       four were beautifully done, so it was hard. The Australian one
       [Tanna] was gorgeously photographed. Land of Mine really captured
       the horrors of war. The Salesman will probably win because there
       will be a big protest vote about [writer-director Asghar Farhadi]
       not being able to get into this country [because of Trump's travel
       ban, now under a stay]. But my heart was with [Sweden's] A Man
       Called Ove. There's something life-affirming about that movie.
       My vote
       A Man Called Ove
     * Best Cinematography
    Dale Robinette/Lionsgate
       Arrival is definitely out. Silence had beautiful photography, but I
       hated that movie so much, with all the Christian stuff beating me
       over the head — I mean, c’mon, Marty [Scorsese, its director]!
       Moonlight and the first half of Lion had some impressive stuff. But
       I voted for La La Land — the cinematography really elevated the
       movie.
       My vote
       La La Land
     * Best Costume Design
    Paramount Pictures
       The costumes in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Florence
       Foster Jenkins and Jackie were really good, but I didn’t like the
       movies. I liked La La Land, but I don’t think the costumes had much
       to do with that — modern things aren’t that hard to design,
       although [Stone] looked great, I have to say. And while I didn’t
       love Allied, the costumes for Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard were
       the best thing about it. In fact, when they had one of those little
       parties for it, I went up to that British lady [Joanna Johnston]
       and told her that, and I don’t think she knew how to respond. Me
       and my big mouth. (Laughs.)
       My vote
       Allied
     * Best Film Editing
    Courtesy of Cannes Film Festival
       This was a really strong category this year. [John Gilbert] did a
       great job with Hacksaw Ridge, but Hell or High Water was my
       favorite film, so I’m gonna stick with it here.
       My vote
       Hell or High Water
     * Best Makeup & Hairstyling
    Anders Nicander
       I didn’t like Suicide Squad very much. The Star Trek [Beyond] DVD
       they sent me stopped halfway through — something was wrong with it
       — so I called them and asked them to send me another, but they
       never did, so that eliminated them! The funny thing is I probably
       would have voted for them. Again, I liked A Man Called Ove — the
       whole movie — so that’s the one.
       My vote
       A Man Called Ove
     * Best Original Score
    Lionsgate
       I really listened to each of them. La La Land’s was very sweet and
       stood out to me the most.
       My vote
       La La Land
     * Best Original Song
    Courtesy of Sundance Institute
       I’m not crazy about any of them — you don’t really remember them
       like you remember songs like “The Way We Were” even years later —
       but I’ll vote for the Sting one [“The Empty Chair,” for which Sting
       is nominated with J. Ralph].
       My vote
       "The Empty Chair" (Jim: The James Foley Story)
     * Best Production Design
    Jaap Buitendijk/Warner Bros.
       Arrival was the first to go. Then Hail, Caesar! and Passengers
       — just mediocre movies. So it was between La La Land and Fantastic
       Beasts and Where to Find Them. I’m sure La La Land will win, but I
       went with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them because I thought
       the production value on that movie was really wonderful, even
       though I wasn’t knocked out by the movie itself.
       My vote
       Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them
     * Best Sound Editing & Best Sound Mixing
    These are the categories I have a really hard time with — it would be
       easier if they just had a “best sound” category, but as it is I’m
       really totally confused and prefer to just stay out of it.
       My vote for both
       [Abstain]
     * Best Visual Effects
    Courtesy of Walt Disney Pictures
       I like the effects in Rogue One, but I voted for The Jungle Book
       because I thought that one, with the animals and everything, was
       absolutely stunning.
       My vote
       The Jungle Book
     * Best Animated Short
    Courtesy of Massive Swerve
       The two that I liked the best were Piper, which is so adorable, and
       the one with the cigarettes where that crazy guy goes to China
       [Pear Cider and Cigarettes], which I voted for because it is very
       intriguing and different.
       My vote
       Pearl Cider and Cigarettes
     * Best Documentary Short
    Courtesy of Netflix
       The one about the immigrants coming across the ocean [4.1 Miles] is
       no different than what you see on the news. What bothered me about
       Joe’s Violin is he said he was a Holocaust survivor, but he wasn’t
       — his mother and brothers were, but he was sent to Siberian gulags
       — and that made me doubt everything else about the story. The two
       about Syria [Watani: My Homeland and The White Helmets] were very
       well done — I almost voted for White Helmets. But I thought
       Extremis was the most human and least contrived.
       My vote
       Extremis
     * Best Live-Action Short
    Courtesy of SND Films
       I thought Timecode was good, but it was more of an intellectual
       exercise, so I went with my heart: I preferred the one about the
       woman and the bike and the train [La Femme et le TGV] because I
       thought there was something really humane about that one. She grew
       from that experience and it had a really positive message.
       My vote
       La Femme et le TGV
