   [17]Super Bowl LI will go down on one of the greatest big games of
   all-time, flesh with legendary performances, the first overtime (and
   extra-period score) and one unthinkable comeback.

   But it also will be remembered as the most historic [18]Super Bowl
   because at least 30 records were broken or tied during the game, most
   of them by [19]Tom Brady and the [20]Patriots.

   Aside from the already-known marks that Brady broke (most appearances,
   most wins by starting QB, most [21]Super Bowl MVPs), the [22]Patriots
   legend's prolific second half put him in statistical rare air,
   according to NFL Research.

   Brady's late-game barrage led him to break numerous [23]Super Bowl
   passing records, including pass attempts (62), completions (43) and
   passing yards (466). The four-time [24]Super Bowl MVP also set marks in
   those all-time categories with 309, 207 and 2,071, respectively.

   But as brilliant as the most valuable player's performance was on
   Sunday, it's his backup scat back who broke the most surprising records
   on the night.

   [25]James White's 14 receptions were the most ever in a [26]Super Bowl
   and his 110 receiving yards were the most by a running back. White's
   three touchdowns tied the [27]Super Bowl record, while his 20 points
   (three TDs, one two-pointer) broke the big game mark. White's
   out-of-the-backfield elusiveness was so vital to New England's victory
   that Brady thought [28]he should have won the MVP.

   Brady and White's dominant evenings contributed to three other marks
   the [29]Patriots' offense set Sunday.

   New England's clock-killing, time-grinding assault set records for most
   first downs (37), most passing first downs (26) and most offensive
   plays (93) in [30]Super Bowl history. The [31]Patriots' historic
   possession of the ball helped facilitate their record-setting 19-point
   fourth-quarter comeback and 25-point second-half rally.

   Here are the other records set or tied in [32]Super Bowl LI (per NFL
   Research):

   Records set
   - Most appearances by head coach: Bill Belichick (7)
   - Most wins by head coach: Bill Belichick (5)
   - Most career passing TD: [33]Tom Brady (15)
   - Most appearances by team: [34]Patriots (9)
   - Most first downs in a [35]Super Bowl by both teams: [36]Falcons and
   [37]Patriots (54)
   - Most passing first downs in a [38]Super Bowl by both teams:
   [39]Falcons and [40]Patriots (39)
   - Most passing yards in a [41]Super Bowl by both teams: [42]Falcons and
   [43]Patriots (682)

   Records tied
   - Most [44]Super Bowl wins: [45]Tom Brady (5)
   - Most sacks in a [46]Super Bowl (since 1982): [47]Grady Jarrett (3)
   - Most 2-point conversions in a Super Bowl: [48]Patriots (2)
   - Most 2-point conversions in a [49]Super Bowl combined: [50]Falcons
   and [51]Patriots (2)
   - Most first downs by penalty: [52]Patriots (4)

   victory parade starts at 10 a.m. ET Tuesday on NFL Network.
