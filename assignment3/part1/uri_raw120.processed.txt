Here Are the Best Memes from Super Bowl 2017: Lady Gaga, Michael Jackson &
the Deflated Falcons

   We all just witnessed an incredible Super Bowl. The New England
   Patriots came back from a 28-3 deficit to beat the Atlanta Falcons with
   the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history, which also featured the
   first overtime period in the big game's 51-year history. [63]Lady Gaga
   also had a great evening, with her triumphant, well-executed,
   subtly-political halftime show. A lot of serious things went down
   tonight in Houston's NRG Stadium, so let's take some time to review the
   irreverent ways in which the Internet made sense of it all.

   We give you the most definitive memes of Super Bowl LI:

   Former President George H. W. Bush made it out for the coin toss, along
   with former first lady Barbara Bush. Last month, the 92-year old
   ex-President was hospitalized for respiratory sickness, forcing him to
   miss Donald Trump’s inauguration. Or maybe he was just ducking Donald?

     ADVISOR: u going to Trump's Inauguration?
     BUSH: Doctor said I can't
     ADVISOR: u wanna hit that super Bowl?
     BUSH: [64]pic.twitter.com/26MlinIdcZ

   Leading up to kickoff, not everyone on hand was ready for some
   football.

   The underdog Falcons jumped out to a 21-0 first half head, with the
   last touchdown coming off a Tom Brady pick-six. The quarterback's
   performance has been deflating before...

   After a quiet first quarter, Atlanta's star wide receiver Julio Jones
   got going in the second quarter, with this incredible sideline catch.
   His effort to get both feet in bounds got people thinking about the
   choreo in [74]Michael Jackson's "Bad" video.

   The cameras flashed to Fox commentator Terry Bradshaw; had he
   unknowingly gone on air with this huge stain on his shirt?

     Um, Terry, you have a little something on your shirt

   A few minutes later, we learned it was just some viral #branding.

     No stain deserves fame. Stains deserve Tide, America’s #1 detergent.

   Did The Simpsons predict Lady Gaga’s halftime show routine? Or was it
   prophesied in Spongebob all along?


     It's a bird!
     It's a plane!
     No...it's Lady Gaga![86]#halftimeshow

   After the Falcons blew a historic lead, what was Steph Curry thinking?
   Maybe people will be easing off those "Warriors Blew a 3-1 Lead" jokes
   now?

   And finally, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell had to present the New
   England Patriots with the Lombardi trophy months after Tom Brady served
   a controversial four-game suspension enforced by the commish. We bet he
   was clenching a lot like Arthur's fist.
