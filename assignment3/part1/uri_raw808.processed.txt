   Muslim Brotherhood & Hitler

   [6]Muslim Brotherhood was founded in Egypt in 1928 by Hassan al-Banna,
   a 22-year old Muslim who admired Adolf Hitler's hatred of the Jews and
   persistently wrote to Hitler to express his admiration for Hitler and
   his desire for collaboration with Hitler's Nazi Party.

   Haj Amin al Husseini and Adolf Hitler When Hitler rose to power, his
   Nazis supported al-Banna, a school teacher, to grow the Muslim
   Brotherhood into its ally in the Middle East; by 1938, the membership
   of [7]Muslim Brotherhood topped 200,000.

   During World War II, members of the Muslim Brotherhood spied for
   Hitler's Nazis in the Middle East and fought for Hitler as Nazi troops
   in two specially formed Muslim Waffen-SS Handschar Divisions (see
   [8]Religion of Peace). 'Handschar' is German for scimitar, the curved
   saber used by the Muslim troops of the Ottoman empire.

   SS Handschar Division Above is Hitler with Haj Amin al-Husseini, the
   Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and a close ally of al-Banna, in Berlin, where
   he lived as Hitler's VIP guest from 1941 to 1945 before joining
   al-Banna in Egypt in 1946. The Muslim Nazi troops of the Waffen-SS
   Handschar Divisions are being reviewed by Haj Amin al-Husseini (right)
   and by SS Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler (below).

   SS Handzar Division Due to their large number of volunteers, Handschar
   Divisions were the largest of Hitler's 38 Waffen-SS Divisions.

   After World War II, Muslim Brotherhood continued to grow, supported
   this time by the West, which saw it as a counterweight to the threat of
   Soviet-backed Communism in the Middle East. By the late 1940s, Muslim
   Brotherhood numbered 500,000 members. While some of them built schools
   and medical clinics, other continued to engage in violence, including
   bombings, arsons and murders. In 1948, members of the Muslim
   Brotherhood assassinated the Egyptian Prime Minister Mahmoud Fahmi
   al-Nuqrashi and participated in the invasion of the newly re-created
   nation of Israel.

   Hamas Salute The Muslim Brotherhood's violent conflict with the
   Egyptian government, which also included the government's assassination
   of al-Banna and two failed Muslim Brotherhood assassination attempts on
   the Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, eventually led to many of
   its leaders being jailed while others fled and established branches
   abroad, mostly in other Middle Eastern Arab nations but also in
   [9]Europe, [10]UK and [11]USA.

   Surmising that it didn't yet have the muscle to [12]spread Islam by
   force, Muslim Brotherhood 'officially' renounced violence in the 1970s
   and adopted more cunning strategies detailed in its secret internal
   manifesto, "[13]The Project." In 1979, Western powers supported the
   Muslim Brotherhood to form the Mujahedeen army and fight the Soviet
   army in Afghanistan.

   god bless Hitler In 1987, the Muslim Brotherhood in Israel created
   Hamas, whose members still use the Nazi salute (above) and read
   Hitler's Mein Kampf, which the Muslim Brotherhood re-titled, My Jihad,
   and translated into Arabic in the 1930s (Mein Kampf remains the #6
   best-seller in the Muslim world today and a favorite among members of
   the Muslim Brotherhood - see [14]Islamophobia).

   In 1989, the Muslim Brotherhood's Mujahedeen army pushed the Soviet
   army out of Afghanistan and then split. One of the factions became Al
   Qaeda, led by a Muslim Brotherhood-schooled Saudi named, Osama bin
   Laden.
