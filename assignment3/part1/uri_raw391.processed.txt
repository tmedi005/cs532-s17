Veterans benefits

   As a retired military veteran, it has caused great concern to me and
   countless others what this government had done to veterans in the area
   of health care. Those that are disabled and need to go to the VA are
   routinely ignored, or given appointments up to six months in advance,
   or totally ignored all together.

   Those that who are not disabled, and retired after at least 20 years of
   service are routinely given more and more obstacles to the health care
   that we are promised. This is what this petition is meant to address.
   To start, a little history is required.

   In 1995, Hillary Clinton was put in charge of a disastrous health care
   policy. The program itself was turned down by Congress, but certain
   parts were allowed to slip through. One part that caused great damage
   to veterans was the limiting of health care.
   One of the lawyers working on this was a gentlemen by the name of
   Phillip Earl Jones from San Antonio. Along with his partner Sean
   Campbell took the case to the Federal Court. Mr. Jones also discussed
   the challenge of trying to revive the health care that veterans were
   promised with Tom Brokaw on the “Fleecing of America in January of
   2001. The case (Bothard,et.al vs DOD and DOJ) was scheduled to arrive
   at the D.C. Court of Appeals when Mr. Jones and Campbell were
   approached by a few senators who wanted to discuss with them “Tricare
   for Life”.

   “ Tricare for life” was to be a program that continued to make sure the
   veterans received the benefits that they deserve. In a handshake deal,
   the case was dismissed among all involved. What was not discussed was
   that to obtain “Tricare for Life” veterans were required to purchase
   Medicare Part B at a cost of $216.00 a month. So it still costs more
   money that many veterans, including myself ,can afford to pay.

   In 2002, the U.S. Court of Appeals reached an astonishing decision that
   military veterans have no legal standing and the U.S. Government could
   break the promise made to them and was not liable to provide lifetime
   health care.

   More well known is the case brought by Colonel George “Bud” Day USAF,
   Ret. In his case, Col Day makes the argument that the decision is
   misguided and should not punish military veterans for budget waste that
   the government is responsible for.
   The Department of Defense, mostly non veteran bureaucrats has willfully
   breached a contract with Americas veterans. Tricare for life has been
   tied to a mandatory payment to Medicare Part B and costs many of our
   older veterans up to $3,600 which they had been promised since the day
   they joined. Many of our older veterans, many with disabilities, have
   been forced to leave military hospitals and forced to rely on Medicare.
   This is the time line provided by classact-lawsuit.com:

   Lawsuit History:
   July 1996: Plaintiffs file suit for monetary damages in Federal
   District Court in Pensacola, FL., charging age discrimination, 5th
   amendment taking of property and breach of contract.
   June 1997: District Court dismisses plaintiffs’ claim of age
   discrimination, but agrees to hear further argument on their 5th
   amendment taking of property and breach-of-contract theories.
   August 1998: District Court denies plaintiffs’ entire petition.
   December 1998: Plaintiffs appeal to US Circuit Court of Appeals for the
   Federal Circuit, Washington, D.C.
   March 2000: Federal court hears oral arguments of the parties.
   February 2001: Three-judge panel of the Federal Circuit Court of
   Appeals, Washington, DC overturns the district court decision. Finds
   that military retirees who entered service before June 7, 1956, had
   been promised free lifetime health care in return for a career of
   military service and were due compensation of up to $10,000 each for
   the government’s failure to live up to that promise.
   June 2001: Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, Washington, DC agrees to a
   rehearing before the full (en banc) court.
   March 6, 2002: Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, Washington, DC hears
   oral argument in the case.
   November 18, 2002: Current court ruling affirming the US Government
   position that military retirees have no legal standing to receive the
   medical care promised
   The government had no problem admitting that the promises were made,
   and even in writing in the manuals provided to the Marine Corps and
   Navy. It was the Department of Defense that convinced the courts that
   the assurances were not backed up by formal law. Even the judges that
   ruled against the veterans were discomforted by the decision. These
   judges claimed “ we can only hope that Congress will make good on the
   promises made in good faith”.
   The dissenting judges were even more forthright: “Our veterans were
   told, if you disrupt your family, work for low pay, endanger your life
   and limb, we will in turn guarantee lifetime health care. There is no
   doubt the government made the offer.”

   Tricare for Life, first incorporated in 2001 as part of the Managed
   Care Support Contracts in 2001. It was enacted by Congress to
   complaints to assist in the payment of rising out of pocket costs to
   veterans and did not require retirees to pay for Medicare. The small
   clause that is not discussed by Congress, once again is the mandatory
   purchase of Medicare Part B to be eligible for Tricare for Life. So
   although there is not cost for Tricare for Life there is a cost
   involved.

   Changes have been made to the US Code that covers military health care.
   The U.S. Code used to read “shall provide” authorized and established
   free health care. In December 1956, the wording was changed to “may”
   provide heath care.
   In 1966, congress created CHAMPUS while changing the law to keep
   veterans from using active duty Military Treatment Facilities.
   It was in 1994 that Congress established Tricare and cancelled all
   health care for retirees over 65, forcing them to spend money many of
   them do not have on Medicare

   Major Commands, recruiters, Unit Commands and from the Secretary of
   Defense on down all made promises that they have broken to veterans
   that have given a major portion of their lives to the country. The
   promise of never having to worry about health care costs for a lifetime
   was a selling point for reenlistments and career choices. Today, there
   is a deep resentment of this government by veterans to those who have
   spent years lying to those who protect our country. The low wages that
   active duty were paid was dismissed as something they must endure to
   get the free health care they were promised, a promise that those who
   have never served broke for budget purposes without thinking of the
   damage done to the veterans involved.

   Doctors are opting out of Medicare and Tricare because once again the
   government has cut the payments to doctors to the point where they lose
   money by assisting veterans. Once again, the government also wants to
   raise co-pays and enrollment fees that military veterans pay. There is
   more, but let’s see what the candidates have to say.
   The question is, how can veterans have any faith in a government that
   lied to them. The numbers of those willing to join the military will
   dwindle as word gets out further that this government does not stand by
   its military retirees, but will spend billions of giving illegal aliens
   everything they need to live well.
   All veterans: I have discussed this with Mr. Phillip Earl Jones who
   along with Bud Day filed court proceeding in Texas about 15 years ago.
