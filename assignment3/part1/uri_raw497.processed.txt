Could Patriots sign Jared Cook if Martellus Bennett leaves?

   Green Bay Packers tight end Jared Cook is set to become an unrestricted
   free agent in March and the New England Patriots should be the first in
   line to bring him on board. At 6-foot-5, 250 pounds, Cook would be the
   perfect replacement if Martellus Bennett signs elsewhere.

   The New England Patriots have said resigning Bennett this offseason is
   a priority, however, it’s unlikely the team is going to be able to keep
   the tight end. Even though Bennett appeared to fit in nicely in New
   England, he’s going to command at on the market, especially after his
   impressive 2016 season in which he put up 701 receiving yards and seven
   touchdowns. With that kind of productivity, another team is going to
   pay him a lot of money.

   If I was a betting man, my money would go on Bennett leaving town. His
   situation reminds me a lot of Darrelle Revis and his contract situation
   with the Patriots. Darrelle Revis signed a one-year contract with New
   England back in 2014, won himself a Super Bowl ring, and then bolted
   town during the offseason for a big payday.

   Bennett appears to be on a similar path. The Chicago Bears traded
   Bennett to the Patriots last offseason, and just like Revis, Bennett
   won his first Super Bowl. Bennett has also made comments on NFL Network
   saying, “I’m going into free agency as a Super Bowl champion. You know
   [20]they overpay Super Bowl champions.”

   So with Bennett likely going to sign elsewhere, Cook would be a great
   fit for the Patriots. He’s abundantly athletic and fast. Belichick
   loves tight ends who can create mismatches and Cook can certainly do
   that. He’s coming off a down year for the Green Bay Packers, playing in
   10 games and starting five. This is music to Bill Belichick’s ears,
   because now New England could easily sign him to a cheap deal, maybe
   even a one-year “prove it” deal.

   Just to give everyone some true insight on the two tight ends, check
   out their career stats below. Both tight ends are turning 30 before
   training camp, and both of these players have remarkably similar
   numbers.

   The Patriots have been a tight-end focused offense ever since they
   drafted Rob Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez in 2010. Tom Brady loves to
   control the middle of the field and the red zone with big tight ends.
   Over the years guys like Scott Chandler, Michael Hoomanawanui, and Tim
   Wright were red zone threats catching touchdown passes from Brady.

   Of course, Aaron Rodgers does have a say in this matter since he did
   mention in his post-NFC Championship press conference that he hoped the
   Packers would re-sign Cook. However, if Cook is looking for a career
   year or to be a focal point of an offense, signing with New England
   makes all the sense in the world.
