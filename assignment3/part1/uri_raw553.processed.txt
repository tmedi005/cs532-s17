Super Bowl is a food economy game changer: Andrew Coppolino

Cultural and sports behemoth is also a food giant, even in Waterloo region

   [75]CBC News
   February 4, 2017

   advertising this year. (Kirby Lee/USA Today Sports/Reuters)

    shares

   The Super Bowl is an enormous entertainment juggernaut, but it's also a
   food giant and a significant driver of restaurant business.

   According to Forbes magazine, the U.S. Department of Agriculture states
   that after Thanksgiving, Super Bowl LI will be the largest food
   consumption day in America. The big game – including the immensely
   popular television commercials and the much-hyped half-time show – has
   a similar impact in Canada.

The numbers

   Statistics [76]cited by Forbes also reveal that on Super Bowl Sunday:
     * Over one billion chicken wings will be consumed.
     * 12 million pizzas will be eaten.
     * Guacamole will be made from 190 million pounds of avocadoes shipped
       from Mexico.
     * It will all be washed down with 350 million gallons of beer.

   In terms of human resources and jobs, Forbes says that in mid-January,
   Pizza Hut hired 11,000 additional employees, and companies delivering
   food can see their business increase by one-third over an ordinary
   Sunday. The magazine also notes that bar owners say that the Super
   Bowl, a day that is to restaurants what Christmas is to retailers, can
   account for nearly 75 per cent of food sales over the year.
   While economists agree on the economic bolster of the global event,
   this crush of bar business in the U.S. is felt in Canada too, where
   business owners remark that the game – this year, it's New England
   Patriots versus Atlanta Falcons in Houston, Texas – has a huge impact
   on the economy.

   Waterloo Region's food and drink industry will also see a boost. Jay
   Taylor of Morty's in Waterloo, a popular sports bar near Wilfrid
   Laurier University since 1981, says that the Super Bowl drives the
   pub's menu.

   "It is our busiest Sunday of the year and our biggest take-out day by
   far," Taylor said. "We will literally sell a ton of chicken wings on
   Super Bowl Sunday."
   hi-wings-852

East versus South

   In addition to the usual pub and football fare, Morty's is preparing
   "tribute foods" of the Super Bowl cities: New England clam chowder and
   chicken-fried steak with spicy "Hotlanta" wings with cayenne and white
   gravy. Dessert is traditional American apple pie.

   "For the wings, we probably do two-thousand for take-out. We have to
   cook them in 15-minute increments," Taylor adds.

   At Cambridge's Gator's Tail, a pub with a Cajun flavour, chef and
   co-owner Alanna Sisto looks for Super Bowl Sunday to drive super sales
   as well.

   "We do about three times the sales during the Super Bowl over a regular
   Sunday. It's a lot of regulars and families. The bar was sold out a
   month ago and there's overflow that comes in. We're big New England
   fans here, so I'll make clam chowder," Sisto says.

Super Bowl 'tribute foods'

   San Francisco-based food writer and editor Anna Monette Roberts also
   believes in comparisons between Thanksgiving and the big game, both in
   sports bars and at home.

   "Instead of gathering around a dinner table with your family, you're
   gathering around a coffee table and television with your friends. The
   game is the centre-piece, but the drinks and food certainly play a very
   large role in the Super Bowl," she says.

   There's little doubt that chili is one of the go-to foods for Super
   Bowl festivities at restaurants and bars; however, for home Super Bowl
   parties, Monette Roberts has created a wide variety of Super Bowl
   recipes that are found on [77]Popsugar.com if you want to make them
   yourself at home.

   "For Atlanta and Georgia," she says, "the two most popular dishes are a
   chili-cheese dog from a drive-in restaurant called The Varsity and the
   Atlanta-based Chick-fil-A fried chicken sandwich served with pickles.
   In Boston, foods could be a lobster roll, either hot or cold, dressed
   with some mayo and of course clam chowder. That latter is from Union
   Oyster House established in 1826. People can re-create these flavours
   no matter where they are."

   In keeping with the general boom in interest in food over the last
   decade or so, Super Bowl food has become more deeply ingrained in
   American – and we can extrapolate Canadian – culture, says Monette
   Roberts.

   "Back in the day, people used to just do simple crock-pot chili," she
   says, adding that heightened interest and information gained from the
   Internet have inspired home cooks.

   "They're very interested in the foods from every city. Each year,
   people research ahead of time what the iconic dishes are from Super
   Bowl cities. They want to have a competition of the food and the
   beer."

Super Bowl grub around this region

   In Kitchener's Eastwood Plaza, [78]Strykerz Kitchen and Bar is cooking
   Super Bowl chili and is having a hot wings-eating contest with a very
   hot Reaper pepper sauce called "Instant Regret" (the Reaper pepper –
   registering two million Scoville heat units – is likely the world's
   hottest pepper).

   [79]Moose Winooski's, just off Sportsworld Drive in Kitchener, says
   Super Bowl Sunday is super busy. Part of their menu includes a
   football-shaped hamburger.

   In northeast Waterloo, [80]St. Louis Bar and Grill will be featuring
   nachos and all-you-can-eat chili dogs with the purchase of a $20
   ticket, which also qualifies you for a chance to win the "Super Bowl
   Squares" game.

   Get there early, because central Waterloo's [81]Morty's Pub, like many
   sports bars, will be packed. The competition on the table will be
   between southern chicken-fried steak and New England clam chowder.
   On Franklin Boulevard in Cambridge, [82]Gator's Tail Sports Shack and
   Grill will have appetizer specials and is preparing chili with
   andouille sausage and Cajun spices.

   Perhaps a little more quiet is the event at Guelph's [83]Borealis
   Grille and Bar on Gordon Street, where they are nevertheless cooking up
   both beef and vegetarian chili was well as wings and nachos. There will
   also be prize draws and Super Bowl Squares.
