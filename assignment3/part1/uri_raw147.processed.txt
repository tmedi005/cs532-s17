   The New England Patriots’ head coach may testify in the double-murder
   trial of a former player.

   FOX’s Gurnal Scott with the story:

   Bill Belichick, who earlier this month won his fifth Super Bowl with
   New England, could possibly take the stand for the defense team of
   Aaron Hernandez.

   Hernandez, a former Patriots’ tight end is charged in the drive-by
   shooting deaths of two men in 2012. In addition to Belichick, New
   England’s offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels could also testify. The
   process of selecting a jury is already underway with March 1 set as the
   date to begin trial.

   Hernandez is already serving a prison sentence for the 2013 of a man
   dating his fiance’s sister.
