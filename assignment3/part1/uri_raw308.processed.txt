   HOUSTON -- Before [22]Tom Brady rewrote the history book one more time
   with the most improbable comeback in a most improbable career, herds of
   foolish sportswriters had their own rewriting to do.

   "I'm sure at halftime you wrote your stories," said a grinning
   [23]Logan Ryan on Sunday night, after the [24]Patriots beat the
   [25]Falcons [26]34-28 in overtime to win Super Bowl LI. "Then you had
   to select it, paste it, delete all and restart."

   We should have known better. Fifteen years after Brady and Bill
   Belichick stunned the football world with one of the great upsets in
   [34]Super Bowl history, they found the only situation possible where a
   four-time champion could confidently be called heavy underdogs: down
   28-3 midway through the third quarter to one of the greatest offenses
   in NFL history. Facing long odds is a role that Brady has always
   relished, though the comeback didn't happen all at once.

   The advanced metrics said the [35]Falcons had a [36]99.6 percent chance
   when they took possession of the ball up 28-12 with 9:44 remaining in
   the fourth quarter, but it didn't take a statistician to know what
   would happen after the [37]Patriots came all the way back to force
   overtime and win the coin toss.

   "When we got to overtime, I basically untied my cleats and watched Tom
   like you guys did," Ryan said.

   It will take time to process what took place in Houston on Sunday
   night. It doesn't take time to know that greatness was witnessed. To
   cement his place as the greatest quarterback of all time, Brady had to
   author the greatest comeback of all time. It's the type of too-perfect
   coda to a too-perfect career -- matched with a too-perfect dimple --
   that even the cheesiest writer would have to delete.

How the Patriots adjusted

   1) [38]Tom Brady and Bill Belichick have five rings in large part
   because they are [39]better at adjusting mid-game than any other player
   or coach. Belichick and defensive coordinator Matt Patricia did a
   fantastic job in the second half, with Patricia giving credit after the
   game to his cornerbacks for providing valuable feedback. Patricia told
   me that he made second-half adjustments in the secondary, leaving Ryan
   and [40]Malcolm Butler on an island while the team sent pressure.

   "You can't sit back in zone coverage down 25 and think you are going to
   win a [41]Super Bowl," Ryan said of the change. "If you ever played
   'Madden,' we were in engage-8. Punt block -- send everyone and hope for
   the best."

   2) One version of the deleted [42]Falcons championship story on Sunday
   night focused on [43]Julio Jones' ridiculous catch over Patriots
   cornerback Eric Rowe with under five minutes left. The catch put the
   [44]Falcons in field-goal range with a chance to go up 11 and put the
   game out of reach. It looked like the crowning moment on an electric
   night by Jones.

   Just two plays later, [45]Matt Ryan made a [46]crucial mistake by
   taking a sack. Defensive tackle [47]Alan Branch described how that
   moment went down.

   "We had a play called with a stunt called. Trey [Flowers] stepped up
   and said, 'Look, let me do the stunt.' He went in there and I covered
   him," Branch said.

   "He likes to step up in the pocket, so anytime you can get inside
   pressure, it's huge," Flowers said.

   Branch's ability to take up blockers has been an underappreciated
   factor to the [48]Patriots' success all season. Flowers' emergence as a
   special pass rusher was on display all night, culminating in [49]the
   biggest defensive play of the Patriots' season.

   3) [50]Falcons pass rusher [51]Vic Beasley insisted that fatigue was
   not the issue for his defense despite the unit being on the field for
   93 plays. He credited Brady's ability to adjust and throw the ball
   quickly.

   "He kind of picked up on our game plan and started throwing quick
   passes," Beasley said.

   The game told a different story. While Brady started to identify where
   pressure was coming from better, many of his big throws down the
   stretch were after deep drops. They took incredible timing,
   anticipation and trust in some of his receivers, like [52]Malcolm
   Mitchell, [53]Chris Hogan and [54]Martellus Bennett. Those three
   players weren't even on the team last season, a testament to
   [55]Brady's ability to coach up his receivers like few others.

Narratives that were busted

   1) Big-name pass rushers aren't always necessary for a title in today's
   NFL. The [56]Patriots won a [57]Super Bowl with Flowers as their best
   defensive player. He finished Sunday's game with 2.5 sacks, two tackles
   for loss and five quarterback hits.

   It's hard to overstate how improbable Flowers' rise has been. A
   fourth-round pick in 2015, he only played one game as a rookie because
   of injuries. He did much of his damage as an inside pass rusher despite
   being just 265 pounds.

   "I saw the other side of it. My opportunity was seemingly fading away.
   It could have," Flowers said Sunday night, before shaking his head and
   praising God.

   2) The [58]Falcons' offense can be stopped. Or, at least, slowed down.
   Atlanta's offense only scored once on six second-half possessions, four
   of which lasted four plays or fewer.

   A safer game plan, especially after [59]Julio Jones' [60]fourth-quarter
   catch, looks advisable in retrospect. But the [61]Falcons didn't make
   it this far -- or [62]lead the NFL in scoring during the regular season
   -- by being conservative. They just came up short at the biggest
   moment.

Super Bowl storylines that deserve attention

   1) [63]Dwight Freeney's spin move will live forever. But he proved
   prescient earlier this week when he bemoaned [64]having to go up
   against Brady again and again on big stages. Freeney deserved a better
   fate Sunday night after beating [65]Patriots left tackle [66]Nate
   Solder snap after snap. Give Freeney an assist on [67]cornerback Robert
   Alford's second-quarter pick-six for pressuring Brady and making him
   throw sooner than he wanted.

   Freeney, perhaps the best pass rusher of his generation, could have
   ended his career on top -- like Hall of Famer Michael Strahan did --
   with a second [68]Super Bowl trophy. Instead, Freeney said after the
   game he's unsure if he'll retire.

   2) [69]James White said he had an idea that he was going to be a big
   part of the game plan in [70]Super Bowl LI, but he didn't know how the
   game would play out. The running back finished with 139 yards from
   scrimmage, 14 catches and a [71]game-winning touchdown in the end zone.

   "I definitely thought I got in," White said about the decisive play.
   "You saw me running away!"

   Leave it to Bill Belichick to roll with White while everyone expected
   [72]LeGarrette Blount or [73]Dion Lewis to dominate the backfield.
   White mostly struggled for two seasons after being drafted as a
   pass-catching back, but the [74]Patriots stuck with him, coached him
   up, and now he's never going to buy a beer in Boston for the rest of
   his life.

   3) Linebacker [75]Dont'a Hightower has recorded two of the biggest
   plays in [76]Super Bowl history, and neither will likely ever receive
   the recognition it deserves. Hightower made the tackle of Marshawn
   Lynch to set up [77]Malcolm Butler's game-winning interception in
   [78]Super Bowl XLIX. And he made the [79]strip-sack of Ryan on Sunday
   night that keyed the [80]Patriots' comeback.

What the Patriots need to do to get back to the Super Bowl

   1) Replenish their defensive free agents: No team in the NFL has more
   key free agents than the [81]Patriots. On their defense alone, key
   contributors like Hightower, Ryan, defensive ends [82]Chris Long and
   [83]Jabaal Sheard, defensive tackle [84]Alan Branch and safety
   [85]Duron Harmon could all get quality deals from other teams looking
   to bring "the Patriot Way" into their building. It's a dangerous
   situation, because New England's defense is lacking core
   difference-makers beyond Butler and Flowers.

   As tight end [86]Martellus Bennett put it: "I'm going into free agency
   as a [87]Super Bowl champion. You know they overpay [88]Super Bowl
   champions!"

   Bill Belichick [89]almost seems to relish reloading his roster every
   season with players on short-term contracts. With [90]LeGarrette Blount
   also set to hit the market on offense, next year's [91]Patriots team
   will be drastically different than the one that took the field at NRG
   Stadium on Sunday night. Strangely, that's how Belichick likes it. It
   makes it even easier for him to convince the 2017 team they are
   starting from scratch.

   2) Get fair value for Jimmy Garoppolo: After a few separate successful
   fill-ins, Garoppolo has shown to be the most promising prospect the
   [92]Patriots have ever had to back up [93]Tom Brady. He's under
   contract next season, and the [94]Patriots shouldn't bother to trade
   him and his two rings away unless they can acquire a bounty for him.
   They should look for a mid-to-high first-round pick and go from there.
   While [95]Tom Brady [96]wants to play another three to five years,
   retaining Garoppolo for another season has plenty of value, too. A lot
   can change in one year, especially with Brady turning 40 before the
   2017 season.

   3) Draft a pass rusher: It's remarkable how well the [97]Patriots'
   defense played all season without much of a pass rush. After dealing
   away linebacker [98]Chandler Jones last offseason, the team could
   desperately use an edge rusher.

What the Falcons need to do to get back to the Super Bowl

   1) Find the right offensive coordinator: NFL Network Insider Ian
   Rapoport reported Sunday that the [99]Falcons might [100]allow
   quarterbacks coach Matt LaFleur out of his contract to join buddy Sean
   McVay in Los Angeles. Chip Kelly is believed to be a realistic
   candidate to take over in Atlanta if he keeps Kyle Shanahan's system,
   which sounds like a recipe for disaster. Shanahan, who is now the
   [101]49ers' head coach, earned [102]his Assistant Coach of the Year
   award and will be very difficult to replace. But it would be ideal for
   the [103]Falcons to find a coach who shares some of Shanahan's
   schematic concepts.

   2) Improve bulk up front: Atlanta's young defense has great team speed,
   but it could still use more strength up front. Second-year player
   [104]Grady Jarrett was a force Sunday night, and third-year pro
   [105]Ra'Shede Hageman made strides late in the season, but the team
   needs more. Another edge rusher to pair with [106]Vic Beasley would
   also be excellent for a team that doesn't need to touch its offense
   much.

   3) Handle success: [107]Devonta Freeman's [108]contract request before
   [109]Super Bowl week was only the beginning. The [110]Falcons will have
   to manage the spoils of being on top better than last year's NFC South
   surprise [111]Super Bowl team, the [112]Panthers. The loss of Kyle
   Shanahan is the most obvious example of what can happen to winning
   teams, but the [113]Falcons will have to get used to being the hunted
   -- and without the championship memories to make the process easier.
