A Look at the New England Patriots Unrestricted Free Agents

   HOUSTON, TX - FEBRUARY 5: LeGarrette Blount #29 of the New England

   Falcons at NRG Stadium on February 5, 2017 in Houston, Texas. (Photo by

   Never one to be complacent, Bill Belichick has already stated that as a
   result of participating in the Super Bowl, his team is about five weeks
   behind in its preparation for the 2017 season. With that in mind, let’s
   take a look at those Patriots who are slated to become unrestricted
   free agents, and examine which may not be on the team for the 2017
   season.

A Look at the New England Patriots Unrestricted Free Agents

[128]Dont’a Hightower

   A team captain, Dont’a Hightower authored two of the most memorable
   defensive plays in team history, first with his goal line tackle of
   [129]Marshawn Lynch in the 2014 Super Bowl, and then his strip sack of
   [130]Matt Ryan in 2016’s big game.  With [131]Chandler Jones and
   [132]Jamie Collins no longer in Foxborough, it should be a no-brainer
   for the team to lock up their Pro Bowl linebacker.  For what it’s
   worth, [133]Devin McCourty indicated after the Super Bowl that
   Hightower will be back in 2017.

   Perhaps he has inside knowledge of ongoing contract negotiations
   between his friend and the team.  Even if he does not, McCourty clearly
   knows that Hightower could be nearly irreplaceable.  The bet here is
   that Hightower will be back.  The Patriots typically use their
   Franchise Tag only as a last resort, so it is fair to assume that if
   Hightower is slapped with the tag, it would only be as a means to buy
   more time to negotiate a long term deal.

[134]Martellus Bennett

   Martellus Bennett poses an interesting case.  He was a productive
   player in 2016, and seemingly ingrained himself into the “Patriot Way,”
   as he contributed as a receiver, a selfless blocker, and played hurt
   for much of the season.  With his tight end counterpart [135]Rob
   Gronkowski coming off of yet another significant injury, it would
   seemingly be wise for the Patriots to keep the talented Bennett in the
   fold.

   However, Bennett will be entering his age-30 season.  This offseason
   will likely represent his last chance at a significant NFL payday.
   Players looking for their most lucrative opportunities rarely end up in
   Foxborough.  What also needs to be considered is Bennett’s eclectic,
   out-spoken personality.  By all accounts, he was a team-oriented player
   in 2016, and beloved by his teammates.  However, Bennett has a track
   record of being a derisive locker room presence, having worn out
   welcomes at his other NFL stops.

   The Patriots represent the fourth team of Bennett’s 9-year career.
   Bennett also displayed a willingness to talk publicly about
   non-football matters, going as far as to speak out against President
   Trump.  It is a fair question to wonder if the security of a
   comfortable contract would lead to Bennett regressing as a teammate,
   and becoming more of the distraction that the Patriots organization
   simply does not tolerate.

   The guess here is that the concerns surrounding Bennett’s age and
   personality will keep the Patriots offer to a fairly-modest level.  As
   a result, Bennett will likely end up elsewhere in 2017.

[136]Chris Long

   Chris Long’s raw stats (4 sacks, 1 forced fumble, 1 run stuff)
   represent very modest numbers in comparison to Long’s early-career
   production.  Despite these somewhat disappointing numbers, Long was
   generally regarded as a player whose contributions were not always
   depicted in box scores.  If Long is willing to take short money on
   another one year deal, he would almost assuredly be welcomed back in
   Foxborough as a rotational player.  Retirement could also be a viable
   option for the 31-year old 9-year veteran.

[137]Alan Branch

   Generally regarded as the Patriots most effective and consistent
   defensive lineman all season, Alan Branch should be back in the fold
   for 2017.  He represents exactly the kind of value the Patriots covet.
    Branch is unheralded and, at 32 years old, should be able to be had on
   a short term deal.

[138]LeGarrette Blount

   Despite a team-record 18 TDs in 2016 and over 1,100 yards rushing,
   LeGarrette Blount’s role on the team was greatly diminished by the end
   of the season.  It is possible that Blount’s powerful running style led
   the 30-year old to wear down over the course of the year.  With
   [139]Dion Lewis and [140]James White under contract, there is
   considerable reason to wonder if Blount will be back in 2017.  If
   Blount is back, it would likely be on a near league-minimum deal, and
   in a reduced role from what we saw from him in 2016.  The early
   assumption here is the Blount will be elsewhere in 2017. The team will
   probably look to replace him with someone younger and more versatile.

[141]Logan Ryan

   Despite some early season struggles in 2016, Logan Ryan has represented
   a serviceable number two cornerback for the majority of the last two
   seasons.  With [142]Malcolm Butler heading towards unrestricted free
   agency in 2018, it is likely the Patriots offers to Ryan will be
   modest.  Expect another team to throw a lot of money at Ryan, ala
   [143]Byron Maxwell, with the hopes of him taking the next step, and
   emerging as a number one corner.  Ryan will likely be elsewhere, and
   handsomely paid, in 2017.

[144]Duron Harmon

   Duron Harmon was considered to be a bit of a reach when the team
   grabbed him in the third round of the 2013 draft.  The fact that the
   team thought more highly of Harmon then, as opposed to other teams,
   possibly suggests that the team still values him a bit more than other
   teams may.  A serviceable backup safety who allows the team to deploy
   [145]Devin McCourty in a variety of roles, there is every reason to
   assume that Harmon will be back in 2017.

[146]James Develin

   The Patriots absolutely love James Develin. In an era when fullbacks
   are somewhat obsolete, there is little reason to expect him to wind up
   elsewhere.

[147]Jabaal Sheard

   Entering the season with high expectations, Jabaal Sheard was a huge
   disappointment in 2016. He did rebound some after Week 11, in which he
   was a healthy scratch. Despite a decent finish to his season, Sheard
   will likely look for a fresh start in 2017.

[148]Brandon Bolden

   Brandon Bolden is similar to Develin, in that the team absolutely loves
   him and will probably pay more for his skill set than other teams.
   Expect the Special Teams ace to be back in 2017.

[149]Sebastian Vollmer

   The long time right tackle missed the entire season due to injury. With
   [150]Marcus Cannon emerging as an All-Pro-level RT, Vollmer will not be
   back in 2017. Retirement is a very likely option for the massive
   German.

[151]Michael Floyd

   Michael Floyd has said all of the right things in terms of how much he
   enjoyed his time in Foxborough and that he would definitely love to
   come back. While it was in a limited time frame, it is clear that Floyd
   was not able to get on the same page as [152]Tom Brady in his 2016
   trial run. With his ongoing legal matters, and the backlash the team
   incurred as a result of signing the troubled wide receiver, the guess
   here is that the Patriots let Floyd resurrect his career elsewhere.

[153]Barkevious Mingo

   The former first round pick was given the chance to restart his career
   in New England. Unfortunately for Mingo, he was unable to surpass
   [154]Kyle Van Noy or [155]Shea McClellin on the LB depth chart,
   relegating him to Special Teams contributions.  If he does not get any
   substantive offers elsewhere, Belichick would likely have him back as a
   core Special Teams piece, if nothing else.  It is probably a good bet,
   however, that Mingo will be given one more chance, elsewhere, to
   establish himself as a pass rusher.

[156]Greg Scruggs

   Greg Scruggs is a depth tight end. With the way Bill Belichick
   stockpiles tight end, its entirely likely Scruggs is back as a depth
   option.
