   Running Back / San Diego Chargers

   Dear 18-year-old Danny,

   I know it still stings. But if there’s one thing I know about you it’s
   that when you get knocked down, you don’t stay down for long. Now, as
   you begin your freshman year of college football, the only thing
   greater than the disappointment of not getting a scholarship offer to
   play at Nebraska is your excitement to join your older brother, Ben,
   and follow in your father’s footsteps at Division II Chadron State
   College.

   When one door to college football closed, God pushed another one open.

   Remember that. It will become a theme — a mantra, almost — for your
   football career.

   Every kid who has ever played youth football in the state of Nebraska
   has had the dream of running out onto the field at Memorial Stadium in
   Lincoln with the N on his helmet. You were no different. You played at
   North Platte High in the fall and went to the Cornhuskers’ football
   camp in the summer. You broke state rushing records. You were named the
   2003 Nebraska player of the year.

   But none of that materialized into an offer. Nebraska looked at your
   five-foot-seven, 175-pound frame and — like other D-I colleges —
   thought you were too small to play running back or even wide receiver.
   Instead, they invited you to walk on … as a kick returner.

   All you’ve ever wanted to do was play football. You’ve known it ever
   since you were a little kid writing jersey numbers on the backs of
   cowboys and Indians and hosting mock football games on your bedroom
   floor. You knew it when you moved those games out to the living room,
   where you colored a football field on the carpet with a green marker
   (Mom and Dad loved that). You knew it when you started playing football
   in the fourth grade, and when you became a ball boy at North Platte
   High, where Dad coached.

   But I know you’ve thought mostly about playing at Nebraska, not in the
   NFL. Not because you don’t think you can play professionally, but
   because you try not to look too far ahead. You know God has a plan for
   you, so you try to focus on what’s right in front of you and run
   through the doors He opens.

   When Nebraska didn’t offer you a scholarship, you handled it well,
   Danny. That door had closed. No sense dwelling on it. Yes, it was
   frustrating. But you handled it with poise — and without animosity.

   You’ll be glad you did, because there will come a time when you’ll need
   some help from the Cornhuskers, and they’ll be there for you. I’ll get
   to that later. For now, let’s talk about the sting of performing at a
   high level, only to be overlooked.

   It’s a feeling you need to get used to, Danny. You’ll feel it again
   when — even though you’ll graduate from Chadron State as the all-time
   NCAA rushing leader — you aren’t invited to work out for NFL scouts at
   the combine.

   Say what you will about God’s plan, but He’s remarkably consistent.

   But so are you — both in your play on the field and in how you overcome
   adversity.

   AP_071006028683

   When the invitation to the combine doesn’t come — even though you’ll
   run for almost 8,000 yards in your college career and win two Harlon
   Hill trophies, the D-II equivalent of the Heisman — you’ll be
   disappointed. On top of that, NFL scouts won’t be interested in
   attending a pro day at tiny and remote Chadron State, so the school
   won’t host one.

   That’s where Nebraska will come in.

   As you’re reading this, Mom is working for a mentoring program called
   Teammates. It was founded by legendary Huskers coach Tom Osborne. He
   and Mom, one of the organization’s regional coordinators, work
   together, and he will see your ability firsthand when he attends a game
   at Chadron State. After he becomes the athletic director at Nebraska in
   2007, you and Mom will ask him if you can work out at the Cornhuskers’
   pro day — and he won’t hesitate to invite you.

   So the same school that didn’t offer you a D-I scholarship will still
   play a huge role in your life by providing the only venue where you can
   display your talent to NFL scouts.

   And just like you did with your opportunity at Chadron State, you’ll
   take advantage. You’ll run a 4.33 40-yard dash, which will be one of
   the fastest times among NFL prospects that year, combine or otherwise.
   Your other numbers will stack up well, too.

   But if you haven’t picked up on the pattern by now, scouts won’t focus
   on your on-field numbers. They’ll only focus on what shows up when you
   step on the scale and when they roll out the measuring tape.

   Say what you will about God’s plan, but He’s remarkably consistent.

   So you can probably guess what draft night will be like for you.

   The rounds will come and go, and you’ll be sitting there, waiting for
   your opportunity. Then, towards the end of the seventh round, you’ll
   get a phone call. It will be from New York Jets coach Eric Mangini.

   But the Jets won’t draft you, Danny. By that time, there will only be a
   few picks left, and the Jets won’t own any of them. Mangini wants to
   see if you’ll sign with New York as a free agent after the draft.

   So the door to the NFL through the draft will close. But you’ll find
   another that’s open, and you’ll run through it by agreeing to sign with
   the Jets.

   GettyImages-92614296

   I wish I could tell you that you’re going to take the NFL by storm and
   have a long, successful career in New York and everybody is going to
   live happily ever after. But just because your life will be going
   according to God’s plan doesn’t mean it’s going to be a fairy tale.

   A couple of days into your rookie training camp, you’re going to get
   carted off the field.

   Torn ACL.

   Injured reserve.

   Done for the year.

   It’s over, you’ll think. I’m never going to play football again. It’s
   not like you to be pessimistic, but it’s a pretty rational thought to
   have. I mean, what NFL team wants an undersized, undrafted rookie who
   just missed a full season after ACL surgery?

   You’ll talk to your wife, Stacia … your wife. That sounds crazy, right?
   The two of you have been dating since freshman year of high school, and
   she’ll be there for you through everything — through the four years
   you’ll spend apart at different colleges eight hours away from each
   other; through pro day and draft night. She’ll even be the one helping
   you as you hobble around on crutches after your ACL surgery. She’ll
   always be there. So that will be the first call you make after your
   injury.

   The second call you’ll make will be to God.

   You’ll pour your heart out in prayer — the frustration, the
   disappointment, the fear that your NFL career will be over before it
   has ever begun.

   Suddenly, all that fear and doubt will leave your mind, and you’ll feel
   a complete change come over you. Over and over in your head, you’ll
   begin to think, I will play next year.

   Maybe it’s God speaking to you. Maybe it’s you realizing that you have
   to stop feeling sorry for yourself, get back to work and trust in God’s
   plan. Nobody said making it in the NFL was going to be easy. And every
   time a door has been slammed in your face, you have found another
   that’s been open. Why should this be any different?

   When all is said and done, tearing your ACL will turn out to be the
   best thing that could have possibly happened to you.

   I know that sounds twisted, but hear me out….

   During your year of rehab and recovery, you’ll have time to learn how
   to live with Stacia as a newly married couple, so the time off will
   benefit your relationship tremendously. It will also benefit your NFL
   career, as you’ll get to sit back and learn from veterans Leon
   Washington, Thomas Jones and Tony Richardson about how to conduct
   yourself as a pro, how to study, how to take care of your body — things
   other rookies will have to learn on the fly while still performing on
   the field.

   You’ll learn how much work you have to put in to make it in the NFL.
   And when the next season comes around, you’ll not only make the team as
   a practice squad player, but you’ll eventually get moved to the active
   roster and even make it on the field for a few games.

   oodhead1.jpt

   But remember, your career is not going to be a fairy tale.

   In fact, after surviving final roster cuts before the 2010 season, the
   Jets are going to release you in Week 2. You’ll hit waivers, and no
   teams will claim you. So every team in the NFL will have a chance to
   grab you, and they will all pass.

   At this point, as you and Stacia are driving back to Nebraska from your
   New Jersey apartment, a familiar thought will creep into your mind:
   Maybe it’s over.…

   Then, back in Omaha, you’ll get a call from your agent. He’ll say he
   has the Patriots on the line, and they want to sign you.

   Like I said, you’re not a pessimistic guy. But this call will come on a
   Friday, two days before the Patriots are supposed to play the Jets. So
   your first instinct will be to think that they only want to sign you to
   get some information. You may not have been in the league long at this
   point, but you’ll know enough about how it works to know that this is
   something teams do.

   But let’s face it: You won’t be in any position to turn down an NFL
   team. So you’ll hop on the next flight to New England to sign that
   contract. You’ll have until 4 p.m. EST to sign the deal to get paid
   that week … you’ll get there at 3:50 p.m.

   Then, you won’t join the team for Sunday’s game. You won’t even talk to
   the Patriots’ coaches until Monday — the day after the Jets game.

   So maybe they didn’t want information from you after all.

   Now, as you’re reading this, it’s 2004 and the Patriots have just won
   their second Super Bowl in three years. Well let me tell you something:
   They’re going to win it again next year. Then they’ll get back to the
   Super Bowl a few years after that. And when you get to New England in
   2010, they’ll still be the class of the NFL. So you’ll feel pretty good
   about where you’ve landed.

   And the timing couldn’t be more perfect, because in that game against
   the Jets, their top receiving back, Kevin Faulk, will tear his ACL. As
   much as you will hate to see that happen to another player — especially
   a guy you’ll go on to become good friends with — it will be a big
   opportunity for you. That Monday, the first day you meet with the
   coaches, they’ll give you a playbook and tell you to start studying.

   The following Sunday, you’ll take the field for the first time in a
   Patriots uniform, and you’ll score your first NFL touchdown.

   AP_100926036961

   Like I said, Danny … you’re not going to set the NFL on fire. But
   you’re going to do everything you’re asked to do and you’re going to
   work your butt off. And that’s how you stay in the league for a long
   time. Talent will only get you so far.

   But you are going to have some big moments.

   In 2011, your second season with the Patriots, you’re going to play in
   the Super Bowl.

   Yes, you. The 18-year-old Nebraska kid who couldn’t even get a D-I
   offer is going to play in the Super Bowl.

   But that’s not even the best part. As the second quarter winds down and
   you’re trailing the Giants 9–3, you’re going to score the go-ahead
   touchdown, releasing out of the backfield and catching a four-yard dart
   from Tom Brady.

   Yes, you. The 18-year-old Nebraska kid who couldn’t even get a D-I
   offer is going to play in the Super Bowl.

   It will be the greatest moment of your football life. But there won’t
   be a fairy-tale ending to this one, Danny. Because despite your big
   moment, your team will lose the game, 21–17.

   I know Dad — being a coach — has taught you that it’s always about the
   team, never the individual. I know you’ve always played that way, too.
   So even though that touchdown will instantly become the highlight of
   your football life, every time you think of it after that night, you’ll
   wish you could trade it in for a Super Bowl ring.

   One thing you’ll never want to trade for anything is your time in New
   England. You’ll spend three amazing seasons there playing with one of
   the greatest quarterbacks in history and learning under a genius of a
   coach in Bill Belichick. Your teammates, the fans — New England will
   hold a special place in your heart.

   Even so, after three years, you’ll decide to leave the Patriots.

   AP_120131129005

   Let me tell you what free agency is going to be like: Excruciating. You
   won’t be a top-tier free agent, so you’ll have to wait until the first
   wave of signings pass before teams start calling. At the beginning of
   free agency, teams will be able to start negotiating with players on
   Saturday and start signing them on Monday. You’ll get an offer pretty
   much immediately from the Patriots to re-sign. But since it’s your
   first time as a free agent, you won’t sign right away because you’ll
   want to see what else is out there.

   So you’ll wait.

   Now, the longer you wait, the greater the risk of the terms of the
   contract offer changing, or it being taken off the table completely.
   That’s why it’s so excruciating.

   Tuesday will pass, no offers.

   Wednesday will pass, nothing.

   Thursday morning, you’ll talk to Stacia. She’ll suggest setting a
   deadline.

   “How about we just pray about it, and if nothing happens by 11 a.m.
   tomorrow, you’ll call your agent and tell him you want take the New
   England deal.”

   You’ll agree.

   Sure enough, 11 a.m. Thursday will roll around, and the Patriots will
   be your only offer. So you’ll call Chris, your agent.

   “Hey Chris. I prayed about it, and I really feel like at this point,
   I’m supposed to go back to New England.”

   “O.K.,” he’ll say. “Anything else?”

   He’ll cut you off before you even have a chance to respond.

   “Wait a second,” he’ll say. “San Diego’s calling.”

   He’ll hang up with you and answer the call. In that moment, even though
   you won’t know if the Chargers are truly interested in you, you’ll know
   in your heart that you’re going to San Diego. The timing will be too
   perfect … it has to be part of God’s plan.

   Chris will call you back, and within three hours, you’ll be a San Diego
   Charger.

   That’s where I’m writing you from, Danny. I’m writing you from my home
   in San Diego as I prepare for my ninth NFL season. I know that’s hard
   for you to believe. I mean, I’m living it, and it’s still hard for me
   to believe sometimes. I still thank God every day for the blessings I
   have in my life. It’s been an incredible ride, and I’m hoping I still
   have four or five years left to play the game that I’ve loved my entire
   life.

   It’s not going to be easy for you to get to where I am, Danny. Your
   road from North Platte, to Chadron State, to New York, to New England
   and finally to San Diego is going to be filled with disappointment.
   There will be obstacles to overcome, and a lot of people will doubt you
   along the way.

   Do yourself a favor, Danny: Let it bother you. You don’t have to be
   that chip-on-your-shoulder, I’m-gonna-prove-everybody-wrong guy. Just
   keep it to yourself and use it as motivation to work harder than
   anybody else. Because that’s what it’s going to take.

   That’s how I got here.

   Work hard. Be a good teammate. Laugh at yourself and don’t take
   yourself too seriously. Enjoy your time at Chadron State, a place that
   you will always hold close to your heart. Enjoy the time you’ll spend
   playing with your brother. And when you get to the NFL, enjoy that,
   too. I know I am. Nine years sounds like a long time, but it’s going to
   fly by. So soak in every moment.

   And finally, trust in God’s plan. When one door closes, don’t get down
   on yourself. Because He will open another. And when He does, do what
   you do best and run through it.

   — Danny

   I was having a great time. Nothing was gonna bring me down. That
   feeling lasted about a week. Then it hit me: “Wait, what now? What am I
   gonna do with myself? What am I gonna do with my life?” And I
   immediately got scared.

Jimmy in, I knew he was one of my own. And my wolf pack – it grew by one, so
where there two – there were two of us in the wolf pack. I was alone first in
the pack and then Jimmy joined in later. And nine months ago, when the
Patriots introduced me to Jacoby, I thought ‘Wait a second, could it be?’ And
I knew for sure- I just added another guy to my wolf pack. So today, I make a
