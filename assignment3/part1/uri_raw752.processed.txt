   Donate to Build THE WALL (et al.) Now! #MAGA, #MHGA
   ** THIS IS 100% REAL - NOT FAKE **
   GOAL: Save American Taxpayers, Start building the U.S./Mexico Border
   Wall in 2017, paid for by Mexico - AMERICANS WANT THE WALL NOW!! This
   also provides other much-needed services - please continue reading!
   President Trump is very intent on building The Wall, but certain things
   are holding him back from getting started on it, and may be on hold for
   YEARS as Congress and the EPA mull over how to do it.  Additionally,
   President Trump has suggested that Mexico would “reimburse” taxpayers
   through a 20% tariff imposed on Mexican imports.  Unfortunately, that
   will raise prices on things Americans love to consume, such as Corona
   Beer, Avocados, and Tequila, and so we will end up paying for the wall
   twice -- once at the outset and a second time through the tariff.
   To avoid this, I am creating The Wall Fundraiser, so that we can (1)
   Start building The Wall as early as this year, 2017, possibly in
   multiple places at once along the 1,954 mile long border; and (2) Use
   money donated by individuals AROUND THE WORLD to defray the cost to
   Mexico so that Americans will not have to pay for The Wall twice, and
   so Americans won’t be punished with a 20% theft to their wallets any
   time they want to enjoy a Tequila Sunrise or an Avocado-Chicken wrap.
   In addition, we import [22]$398,000,000 of coffee from Mexico, and I
   would personally suffer from an additional OUTRAGEOUS 20% TAX HIKE in
   coffee!!
   There are many differing estimates on how much The Wall would cost,
   ranging from $12B to $25B and above.   I decided on a goal of $14B to
   get things rolling NOW.  If I need to raise more at a later date, I
   will start another fundraising campaign at that time.  Since this
   fundraiser is open to donations from all over the world, that means
   Americans won’t be the ones initially bearing the entire brunt of
   these costs.  And hopefully Mexico will appreciate it as well.
   The  funds raised will be disbursed as follows: One portion will be
   deposited directly to a fund to be used by Mexico’s government for the
   SOLE PURPOSE of paying for The Wall.   This will ensure the wall will
   be built SOONER rather than later as it gets bogged down in
   governmental red tape. The second portion of discretionary funds will
   be given to a [23]charity or charities of my choice that will help with
   Mexican education, jobs, and infrastructure, which will give Mexicans
   less of a desire to cross the border into the U.S. to steal our jobs or
   use our benefits or raise their families in a safe place, whatever
   reason it is they come here for, these funds should STOP THEM FROM
   ILLEGALLY CROSSING OVER BOTH PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY.  We certainly
   don’t want their drug dealers or rapists coming here, just as they
   don’t want our drug dealers and rapists going over there, so it’s a
   win-win.
   I intend for this fundraiser to be open and honest and transparent,
   just as our President is, and to do what I say I will, just as
   President Trump is doing.  After any overhead & fees are met, 100% OF
   PROCEEDS WILL GO TOWARD THE WALL CAMPAIGN.
    WE ARE MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, one American at a time, and I will
   be the first American volunteer to go forth in this TREMENDOUS
   ENDEAVOR.  WIN-WIN!!
   Thank you for your donation! NO AMOUNT IS TOO SMALL OR TOO LARGE!  We
   have a long way to go to get there, but I’m confident there are enough
   PATRIOTIC AMERICANS and others in the world who WANT TO GET THIS DONE
   IMMEDIATELY.  If the the ACLU can raise [24]$24 Million in one weekend
   over the President’s ONE executive order, then I am confident we can
   get to our goal of $14 Billion inside a month!  We should at least
   start construction in 2017! Are more Patriots interested in The Wall
   than in the ACLU?  Let's find out!!
   To you good people outside the USA who also Love America, please give
   as your heart desires.   I personally appreciate your generosity! My
   goal is to bring our international allies together in strength for this
   great cause.
    If you don’t wish for your name to appear as a donor to The Wall et
   al., you may donate anonymously.  It may be important for you to be
   anonymous if you are a secret Trump voter or a passionate American who
   truly understands what this cause is about.  No worries, I won’t
   snitch!  I promise.
   THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR DONATION!!
   * I will post all updates as I get them, with expenses included, and
   The Wall Fund will be sent monthly and/or as donations are given, as
   outlined above.

   I am one person, but I plan to persist and work toward this goal all
   year. I don't have a corporation or wealth to spread advertising around
   the world, but I have passion and will continue to look for business
   partners who will pledge to match funds or donate time & supplies. This
   is a monumental effort for just one person, but I am grateful for the
   help I have with sharing the word, sharing this link, and with that it
   may take off.
   I don't have a sob story to help this go Viral - only faith in others
   to hep. I don't have a political agenda to sell to the DNC or RNC -
   only my love for America. I do have the objectivity and huge desire to
   do the right thing. We can't ever give up on DOING THE RIGHT THING!

   Someone mentioned a brick program fundraiser, as is done for schools
   and museums and other places. I actually considered this first, as part
   of the Wall fundraiser idea came from a school brick program. This
   won't work, however, since the "bricks" these companies use are for
   paving and walkways, and much of the Mexico Wall won't be made from
   bricks like these. Also, permits will need to be secured from public
   and private land owners along the border, so the wall can only be made
   in sections instead of one continuous project.
   This did give me an idea of having Rewards for donation levels. The
   paving companies who have the brick fundraiser programs often give
   mementos to donors, including scaled-down "Gift Bricks" as paperweights
   or even full-sized engraved bricks as a keepsake. If this fundraiser
   generates enough interest and inquiries, I will look into doing this
   for various Reward levels. I welcome everyone's ideas to get this idea
   launched as we proceed.

   In the last week, hundreds of thousands of dollars have been given to
   political factions like the ACLU, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and the
   DNC/RNC. I am a one-person crew trying to do the right thing, so I plan
   on spreading the word every day, everywhere that I can. But I need help
   spreading the word, and asking for donations. This is an IMPORTANT
   CAUSE, and I won't stop! Thank you for sharing this link, and for
   helping America become a better place.

   Through the magic of mathematics, I've learned that if every U.S.
   citizen contributes $40, the job is done. However, since this is a
   world wide campaign, it can be done a lot sooner. Please consider
   donating as your heart allows, and please continue to share. Even if
   you are against building a wall, you can still feel good about
   donating, as this campaign also goes toward building up the Mexican
   people so they have a better life at home. You're not just buying
   bricks, you're making the world a better place. xoxo
