   [48]Candida Yeast Culture

   Candida Yeast Culture

   Anti-Candida Therapy – Dr. Tulio Simoncini MD (www.cancerfungus.com)
   discovered that sodium bicarbonate kills candida and when the candida
   is dead, the body can focus on more important health problems like
   cancer. We traveled to Italy to learn directly from Dr Simoncini so we
   can carry out this therapy with more expertise than anyone else in this
   country! This therapy trumps all other anti-candida therapies. We get
   all the people who have done everything else and we are the ones who
   finally help them kill the fungus that’s been plaguing them for so
   long. We have even seen clients who have gone to other clinics to
   supposedly get this treatment done and come to us afterwards because it
   was done incorrectly. Don’t waste your time, come to the best!
   Anti-Candida programs are typically 3 weeks long.

   Kinesiology – testing to provide information on your body’s nutritional
   needs, heavy metal toxicity, allergens, viruses, bacteria, fungi, mold
   and parasites. Not only can Kinesiology be used to determine a problem
   in the body, but also a solution.

   Food & Allergen Screening (No Needles) – Fruits, vegetables, grains,
   meats/poultry, multiple types of fish and seasonal pollens as well,
   over 250 substances tested.

   Energy Integrations – Integrate all parts of your being (body, mind,
   soul, spirit, ether/energy) together to strengthen your focus on
   attaining your goal.  Integrations focus all of who you are as a person
   toward the goal you’re attempting to accomplish, whether that’s health
   related or if its financial, marital, or sports related, integrations
   take you to the next level in your development as a person.

   [49]Microscope


   Live Blood Analysis – Digestive function, organ toxicity and free
   radical damage can all be seen in live blood when looked at under a
   microscope.  Bacteria (Lyme’s and related co-infections) and parasites
   (blood/lymph/liver flukes) can also be seen and treatment progress can
   be monitored. Your blood should show changes if your health is
   improving!

   [50]Oxygen-Ozone-Sauna

   Oxygen/Ozone Therapy – Internal administration of Oxygen/Ozone gas to
   strengthen (and regulate) the immune system, decrease
   bacteria/virus/fungi/mold presence in the body, increase energy levels
   and metabolism, plus so much more.  This is one of the best therapies
   we could ever offer!

   Ozone Sauna – Very relaxing and incredibly therapeutic steam sauna
   filled with pure Oxygen/Ozone.  One of the best things about this style
   of sauna is that your head is not inside the steam, so your face feels
   nice and cool and you don’t breathe hot moist air.  Burn up to 600
   calories during this relaxing metabolic booster and rejuvenate all your
   muscles while stimulating detoxification.


   [51]scientist doctor hand holds virtual molecular structure in the l

   Oral Liposomal Therapy – Christopher Hall has produced a new form of
   equipment which can take any of our IV therapies and turn them into a
   liposomal solution that can be taken by mouth (No Needles!) and deliver
   the same nutrients to your cells but in a more effective manner.

   Electrostim/Micro-Currant Therapy – Chronic and acute pain relief
   through gentle electrical stimulation of the muscles, using ultrasonic
   frequencies.  Cellulite decreasing frequencies through electrical
   impulses are sent to target areas where fat deposits have settled and
   are hard to burn with traditional exercise.

   [52]skin-protecting-body-from-bacteria

   Hypnosis/Meditation – Using brain wave frequencies we can bring your
   life into balance with guided meditation and hypnosis.  Get through the
   blocks and sabotage that keep you from reaching the stars.  Christopher
   has worked with multiple professional athletes to help them become
   world champions and in some cases multiple world title holders.  He has
   also helped people to overcome negative thought around cancer, fears,
   phobias and even addictions.

   Metabolic Testing – This very sophisticated test takes only 10 minutes
   to complete.  What we do is measure the amount of oxygen you inhale
   verses the amount of CO2 you exhale, along with your heart rate.  This
   gives us your metabolic rate, meaning how many calories you burn every
   day.  It also provides detailed information on the amount of Carbs and
   Fat you burn every day, so we can build a custom meal plan and exercise
   plan for you to meet your goals. No more wondering if you have a slow
   metabolism because you can’t lose weight, get tested and get healthy!!!

   VO2/CO2 Max Testing – Ready to take your workouts to the next level?
   Get tested with our VO2/CO2 Max testing, so we can help you to
   understand how to get the most out of your training and excel beyond
   what you ever thought possible.  If you’re already a regular exerciser,
   you might as well get detailed information on what exactly your body’s
   doing during the workout so you can perform better and make the most of
   the time you spend training.

Testimonial

     *  &nbspI had been taking antibiotics for an infection. As always
       when on antibiotics, I got a yeast infection. The Ozone treatment
       took care of the yeast infection right away. I also used to get
       migraine headaches 2 or 3 per week since I started my ozone
       treatments they haven’t returned.
       H.E. Rio Rancho, NM
     *   “Ozone therapy helped to clear up my 4-year-old daughter's cyst
       on her neck in just a few weeks, and it's helped with my stretch
       marks that are four years old! They appear much lighter after only
       one treatment and my skin tone was firmer. I look forward to
       continuing our family's ozone treatments. I’m a 22-year-old mother
       of two.”
       D.P. Albuquerque, NM
     *   “I have had great experiences with ozone treatments. For myself,
       after my first ozone treatment, I had a huge energy boost and felt
       really great. My husband, had a head cold & felt very awful but
       couldn’t get in for a treatment. I took him a glass of ozone water,
       which cleared up his head cold within the hour. He felt great &
       continued to feel great the following days after. I also use the
       ozone lip balm, and my lips feel much softer. I recommend ozone for
       every sickness or illness that you may have.”
       L.M.B. Albuquerque, NM
     *   “My daughter is 28 years old and has a very progressive form of
       Multiple Sclerosis. She has had it for 4 years and we have noticed
       improvements during the ozone treatments over the last month. She
       has more strength in her voice, the shaking in her muscles has
       calmed down, the numbness in her legs has gone away and they are
       getting stronger. We are going to stick with the treatments because
       we can see the difference.”
       L.L. Albuquerque, NM
     *   “Over a year and a half ago I began seeing Natalie at Alternative
       Health Concepts. During that time, I have been immensely impressed
       with the treatments and all of the various modalities they offer. I
       have seen my health steadily increase over time. Chris and Natalie
       are constantly striving to ensure that they have the most recent
       equipment and a variety of treatment options to ensure optimal
       health. In recent months, they have incorporated the ozone therapy,
       which I have been very excited about. It has helped me tremendously
       with skin, digestive, and menstrual problems. It has been great for
       my kids, too! The treatments are always done in a professional and
       comfortable manner. I highly recommend Alternative Health Concepts
       for ANY person who wants to work on prevention as well as those
       dealing with illness.”
       J.C. Albuquerque, NM
