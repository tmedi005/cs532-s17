   [401]New England Patriots

   NFL Network's Ian Rapoport suggests the Patriots could transition tag
   free agent ILB Dont'a Hightower.
   The Patriots want to keep Hightower but haven't had any talks since the
   end of the season. There's some concern over giving him a multi-year
   deal after durability concerns surfaced in 2016. Transition tagging
   would be cheaper than franchising Hightower but only guarantees New
   England the ability to match any offer. Hightower is reportedly
   targeting more than $10 million annually. Feb 22 - 5:31 PM
   Source: [402]Ian Rapoport on Twitter
   ESPN's Mike Reiss said impending free agent LB Dont'a Hightower "is the
   prime candidate to receive the franchise tag if the Patriots decide to
   use it."
   New England could decide not to use the tag, but if they do, Reiss
   expects it to be on Hightower. CSN New England's Tom Curran expects
   Hightower to reach the open market after the two sides did not have any
   meaningful talks late in 2016, but the Patriots could decide to keep
   the linebacker on the relatively risk-free, one-year franchise tender.
   With some durability concerns, Hightower should be looking to get as
   much guaranteed money as possible this spring. Former teammate Jamie
   Collins landed $26.4 million guaranteed from the Browns earlier this
   offseason, which should be the baseline for Hightower. Feb 13 - 10:41

   Free agent MLB Dont'a Hightower is expected to reach the open market.
   Per reporter Tom Curran, there were no "extensive talks" between
   Hightower and the Patriots down the stretch of the 2016 season. Curran
   expects the Pats to sketch out the "parameters of what they will offer
   with the understanding Hightower will test the market." There have been
   indications Hightower is seeking more than $10 million per season. Feb

   Free agent MLB Dont'a Hightower (shoulder) is expected to avoid
   offseason surgery.
   Hightower dealt with knee and shoulder injuries throughout the year. He
   missed three games, but was never fully healthy. It's good news for
   Hightower's free-agent stock. Hightower reportedly turned down more
   than $10 million annually from the Patriots before the season. Feb 8 -

         Patriots placed TE Rob Gronkowski (back surgery) on injured reserve.
         The Patriots already designated a player to return, so he's done for
         the rest of the season/playoffs. Gronkowski underwent his third back
         surgery Friday but is expected to make a full recovery. He should be
         healthy for the start of 2017 OTAs.

         Sidelined
         Patriots placed OG Tre' Jackson (knee) on reserve/PUP.
         It'll cost Jackson at least the first six weeks of the season. We
         assume Jackson's issue stems from an offseason knee scope. Last year's
         No. 111 overall pick started nine games as a rookie. The Patriots are
         moving forward with rookie Joe Thuney and Jonathan Cooper as their
         starting guards.

         Sidelined
         ESPN Boston doesn't expect the Patriots to retain RT Sebastian Vollmer.
         Vollmer is done for the season after not getting activated from
         reserve/PUP. He's been one of the better tackles in the league when
         healthy, but has missed 29 games the last four years. Once released,
         Vollmer will likely have to settle for short-term contract offers. He
         may also decide to hang up the cleats pushing age 33.
