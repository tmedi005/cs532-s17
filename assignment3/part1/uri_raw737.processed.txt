About Super Bowl LII Business Connect

   The NFL Business Connect program is the National Football League’s
   Super Bowl and special event supplier diversity initiative. This fall
   the
   Minnesota Super Bowl LII Host Committee, in partnership with the NFL,
   will launch the Super Bowl LII Business Connect program. The program
   will serve as a conduit for qualified, diverse and underutilized
   businesses in Minnesota to compete for contracting opportunities that
   will be generated by Super Bowl LII in 2018. Additionally, the program
   will offer networking, educational and other business development
   opportunities for local, event services businesses in the 13 counties
   surrounding the Twin Cities.

   The Super Bowl LII’s Business Connect Program is focused on creating
   contract and business development opportunities for certified
   minority-, woman-, veteran-, lesbian, gay, bisexual and/or
   transgender-owned qualified, diverse businesses.

   Experienced, event-ready, local businesses in the region must register
   by April 30, 2017 to participate in the program’s contracting
   opportunities through Business Connect and the program’s educational
   workshop series, which will be presented quarterly in 2017.

Advantages of Business Connect

   To join the Super Bowl LII Business Connect program applicants must
   complete the online registration. The MN Host Committee will review all
   applications and if approved, will communicate your successful
   partnership into the program.

   The Host Committee will post the business information and company
   profiles provided by each participating business in the Super Bowl LII
   Business Connect Resource Guide (BCRG). The BCRG is the online database
   of approved, registered businesses that helps Super Bowl contractors
   and event producers, including the NFL, identify and select local
   businesses to partner with to complete their Super Bowl LII events.

   Super Bowl LII Business Connect offers events, workshops and resources
   to help prepare businesses to participate it the Super Bowl procurement
   process, including but not limited to networking with representatives
   of the NFL and its key contractors. The networking opportunities are
   key in that they will provide businesses access to the NFL and their
   preferred contractors along with Host Committee corporate sponsors and
   local small business service providers.

   Please note that participation in the Super Bowl LII Business Connect
   program does not guarantee Super Bowl LII-related contracts or
   business. Opportunities will have limited availability due to high
   interest in the program. The NFL and Host Committee are committed to
   maximizing local diverse small business participation. Registration
   with Super Bowl LII Business Connect facilitates the opportunity for
   Minnesota businesses to compete for the chance to provide goods and
   services to Super Bowl LII.
