Some NFL executives reportedly believe the Patriots will get a 'blockbuster'
offer for Jimmy Garoppolo

   [630967012.jpg?resize=640%2C640] Some NFL executives reportedly believe
   the Patriots will get a ‘blockbuster’ offer for Jimmy Garoppolo
   [5891f650c4d21f45b27406cd_o_F_v1.jpg?w=640]

   Jimmy Garoppolo’s short two-game stint as starting quarterback of the
   New England Patriots was enough to convince other NFL teams that he can
   be their man.

   Garoppolo didn’t even finish his second start during Tom Brady’s
   suspension before he got hurt, handing the reins to Jacoby Brissett.

   But in those 1.5 games, Garoppolo looked impressive, completing 68% of
   his passes for over 400 yards and four touchdowns, with no
   interceptions.

   With one year left on Garoppolo’s contract and a shortage of good free
   agent quarterbacks, many people expect the [32]Patriots to receive
   calls about trading for Garoppolo. Quarterback-needy teams like the
   Cleveland Browns and Chicago Bears may pursue him hard, hoping his
   Patriots pedigree can transfer with him.

   [33]According to Bleacher Report’s Mike Freeman, some NFL executives
   believe the Patriots will get “an offer for Jimmy Garoppolo they cannot
   refuse.”

   As Freeman notes, trading Garoppolo before he’s due for a big pay day
   would be consistent with how the Patriots have treated impending free
   agents. They traded valuable defenders in Jamie Collins and Chandler
   Jones, in part, because they were approaching free agency.

   Garoppolo is an interesting case, though. Of course, Brady showed no
   signs of decline in helping the Patriots make the greatest Super Bowl
   comeback in NFL history, but he is 40 years old and just took nine QB
   hits in 15th game of his 17th season. He’s got a ton of miles.

   Brady will retire one day and the Patriots will need a backup. Perhaps
   they think Brissett can be that guy. Perhaps they think they can draft
   a replacement or sign one in free agency. However, it’s worth wondering
   if the Patriots think it’s worth hanging onto Garoppolo as insurance
   when Brady’s career is done.

   There’s been enough indication that teams will certainly call about
   Garoppolo. What remains to be seen is how badly teams want him and how
   high the price would have to be for the Patriots to get rid of him.
