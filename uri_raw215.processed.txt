   FAIRVIEW, Tenn. — Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn returned to her
   district Tuesday in Tennessee and was greeted by tough questions on
   topics from health care reform to President Donald Trump’s Cabinet
   appointees. She also was met with protests.

   While 100 people crammed into her town hall gathering about 30 miles
   from Nashville, another 100 people outside chanted about immigrant
   rights, Planned Parenthood and other topics in protest against the
   congresswoman and the president.

   Blackburn’s town hall was among several protests lobbed at GOP members
   of Congress returning home this week on break to their districts around
   the U.S. Now many Republican lawmakers are opting against holding
   public town halls, instead organizing conference calls or meeting
   privately.

   The crowd inside Blackburn’s event held up signs that said “agree” and
   “disagree,” and at times yelled out “alternative facts” and “shame on
   you for lying” after Blackburn’s responses.

   “I have always said, you may not agree with me, but you’re always going
   to know where I stand,” Blackburn told the protesters outside Fairview
   City Hall afterward. “Having a good, solid, respectful debate, that is
   something that serves our country well.”

   A month into Trump’s presidency, protests continue over his immigration
   policies, Cabinet selections and the GOP’s push to repeal the
   Affordable Care Act, without all the specifics on how to replace it. At
   the town halls, protesters are probing their lawmakers to see if they
   will veer from some of Trump’s more controversial decisions, and if
   they will promise coverage for those currently served by the Affordable
   Care Act.

   Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday to address the town halls.

   “The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are
   actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists. Sad!” he
   [72]tweeted.

   In two small Iowa towns, overflow crowds similarly lobbed questions
   Tuesday at Republican Sens. Charles Grassley and Joni Ernst.

   About 18,000 callers participated in a telephone town hall with
   suburban Chicago Rep. Peter Roskam, who has been criticized for
   canceling smaller in-person meetings and declining debates.

   Protesters booed in Montana when Sen. Steve Daines canceled his speech
   to state lawmakers. And at a protest town hall in Allentown,
   Pennsylvania, home of Sen. Pat Toomey, the protest group called
   Tuesdays with Toomey hung an empty suit in place of the senator.

   Similarly, a liberal group in Maine is holding its own town halls
   against GOP Sen. Susan Collins.

   Also Tuesday, the most powerful member of the U.S. Senate faced jeers
   from nearly 1,000 as he arrived to address a group of local business
   leaders. In Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, they chanted as Senate Majority
   Leader Mitch McConnell entered the American Legion Post 34 Fairgrounds
   in a black limousine.

   McConnell said he was “proud” of the demonstrators for expressing their
   views but told the mostly friendly audience inside that the protesters
   “had their shot,” adding: “Winners make policy and the losers go home.”

   Sandra Brown, 45, said politics shouldn’t matter as Congress moves to
   replace the health care law. She spoke at the Tennessee town hall about
   how the Affordable Care Act helped cover her pre-existing condition.

   Blackburn said the plan for efforts to repeal and replace the law
   includes maintaining coverage of pre-existing conditions and young
   adults on their parents’ plans.

   “Whatever they do, it needs to be affordable for everybody,” Brown said
   after the Tennessee town hall. “Because even the people that voted for
   a Republican, they’re not going to be very happy if they’ve been
   promised they’re going to repeal this Affordable Care Act and then they
   replace it with a garbage policy. They’re going to be affected as
   well.”
