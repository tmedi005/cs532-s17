Martellus Bennett responds to critics, asks if they would be willing to take
a pay cut

"And stop @'ing me about taking less money."

   Boston Globe's Point After newsletter delivered for free to your inbox.

   Following [61]reports he might leave the New England Patriots, tight
   end Martellus Bennett turned the question around on those asking him to
   stay for less money: Would they take a pay cut at their jobs?

     And stop @'ing me about taking less money. You take less money and
     your job? All of you take a pay cut hahaha.

     ‚Äî Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) [62]February 22, 2017

   Bennett also characterized the reporting on his impending free agency
   decision as ‚Äú[63]irresponsible‚Äù [64]speculation and dismissed a Twitter
   user‚Äôs accusation that he was basking in the attention.

     Bro I don't care about this attention shit. What does having your
     attention do to better my life? You have no idea what you're talking
     about [65]https://t.co/WPVjwf5FJs

     ‚Äî Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) [66]February 22, 2017

   ‚ÄúAll I‚Äôm saying is cut your own grass don‚Äôt be all in my garden f[‚Äî]ing
   with my fruit while weeds are growing all over yours,‚Äù he [67]vented,
   before ending the series of tweets on a note of well wishes.

     Anyways I love you all. ü§óü§ó I hope you all get a raise today or
     tomorrow.

     ‚Äî Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) [68]February 22, 2017

   After [69]being traded to the Patriots in the final year of his
   contract last year, Bennett made 55 receptions for 701 yards and seven
   touchdowns during the 2016 regular season. With fellow tight end Rob
   Gronkowski sidelined due to injury, the newcomer also played a key role
   in the team‚Äôs Super Bowl run.

   NFL.com‚Äôs Ian Rapoport [70]reported Tuesday that it was a ‚Äúreal
   possibility‚Äù that Bennett leaves the Patriots this offseason, as the
   team is unwilling to pay him a salary over Gronkowski‚Äôs $9 million
   annual figure. Bennett [71]reportedly made just over $5 million this
   past season.
